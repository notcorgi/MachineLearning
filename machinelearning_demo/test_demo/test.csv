BC-HEALTH-LD-CONGO HEALTH-LD-CONGO KIMBERLEY June 18 Sapa POSSIBILITY OF CONGO FEVER RECEDES: DOCTOR 
	
	
 The Kimberley Provincial Hospital said it would probably know by Tuesday whether one of its patients had Congo Fever. 
	
	
 Medical Department head Dr Hamid Saeed said the patient's blood had been sent to the Institute for Virology in Johannesburg for analysis and the results of the first two sets of tests -- for illnesses other than Congo fever -- arrived back on Monday night and were negative. 
	
	
 A set of tests specifically for Congo fever were still outstanding. 
	
	
 Saeed said indications were that those tests would be negative too. He said it was his opinion that the patient -- a woman -- was suffering from tick bite fever. 
	
	
 The two have similar symptoms. 
	
	
 The woman was admitted to the hospital on Saturday after complaining of severe joint pains. 
	
	
 She also had a skin rash and was vomiting. 
	
	
 The patient told hospital authorities she became sick after being bitten by a tick about four months ago. 
	
	
 Although the woman's condition had deteriorated on Sunday it was showing improvement on Monday. 
	
	
 By afternoon she was conversing with her husband after being semi-comatose in the morning. 
	
	
 Between one and 10 cases of Congo Fever are reported in South Africa annually, with about 20 to 25 percent of patients dying, according to statistics from the virology institute. 
	
	
 A total of 158 cases of Congo Fever were diagnosed in southern Africa between 1981 and the end of 2000. 
	
	
 Early symptoms of the disease include severe headaches, red eyes, fevers and cold chills, body pain, and vomiting. 
	
	
 The disease can be contracted if a person is bitten by a certain tick or if a person comes into contact with the blood of a Congo Fever sufferer.

Beijing has completed the afforestation of 4,000 hectares over the past six months, the municipal forestry bureau revealed yesterday. 
	
	
 ""We planted trees mainly in the major five areas that are severely endangered by sandy wind,"" said Cai Baojun, an official with the bureau in charge of forest planting. 
	
	
 The shifting dunes in Beijing's suburbs and rural areas have been successfully controlled by green barriers of trees and grass, which have also helped upgrade the city's forest proportion to 43 per cent, 23 percentage points higher than the nation's metropolitan average. 
	
	
 A 200-metre belt of trees has been planted on each side of the Yongding, Chaobai, Dasha and Wenyu rivers, which was previously the city's most desertificated land. 
	
	
 Forestry experts said dry weather and temperature fluctuations were the main cause of sandstorms. 
	
	
 The repeated breaching of the embankments of the Yongding and Chaobai rivers also resulted in the desertification of the land with heavy sand being deposited by floods. By 2005, 50 per cent of Beijing's land, including both urban and rural areas, will have been covered with trees. 
	
	
 The green belts have helped protect the crops from sand, wind, drought and floods to guarantee grain production, Cai said. 
	
	
 Over the next 10 years, China will invest 6 billion yuan (US$720 million) to prevent sandstorms hitting Beijing, according to sources from the State Forestry Administration. 
	
	
 Private organizations are also being encouraged to help fight sandstorms, according to the administration's vice-director Li Yucai. 
	
	
 Favourable taxation policies will also be given to people engaged in the transformation of desertificated land. 
	
	
 Beijing was struck by sandstorms several times this spring. It is believed that sand from northern areas, especially the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and floating dust from the city's uncovered construction sites are the main causes.

BRUSSELS, June 29 (AFP) -- Nearly 100 donor countries and international organizations opened their checkbooks here Friday to bail out struggling Yugoslavia after Slobodan Milosevic's lightning transfer to the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. 
	
	
 ""Nobody is happy when a former president is taken before the tribunal in The Hague, but it had to happen and the sooner the better,"" Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus told reporters on his arrival here. 
	
	
 The donors' conference, co-sponsored by the European Commission and the World Bank, was hoping to raise 1.25 billion dollars (1.47 billion euros) for Yugoslavia this year for urgent repairs to infrastructure and salaries to teachers and other civil servants. 
	
	
 By midday, the conference had garnered pledges totalling some 1.37 billion dollars in grants and low- or no-interest loans over the next three years, against the target figure set by the World Bank of 3.9 billion dollars for what Belgrade would need for the three-year period. 
	
	
 The European Commission anounced it had pledged a financial package of grants and loans totalling 530 million euros (450 million dollars). 
	
	
 ""This pledge is in addition to the pledges of individual EU member states that will be made separately at the conference,"" said Gunnar Wiegand, spokesman for External Affairs Commissioner Chris Patten. 
	
	
 Labus said the United States, which had until the last minute been uncertain of attending the conference, contingent on Milosevic's extradition, pledged 181.6 million dollars during the morning session. 
	
	
 A German source said Germany had pledged 153 million marks (66.32 million dollars). 
	
	
 Japanese Ambassador to the EU Takayuki Kimura said his country had pledged 50 million dollars, in addition to technical assistance and another 10 million dollars to the whole of southeast Europe, most of it to Yugoslavia. 
	
	
 Johannes Linn, World Bank vice-president for Europe and Central Asia, said the bank had pledged 150 million dollars for the current calendar year and ""over the next three years we expect to support Yugoslavia to the tune of about 540 million US dollars in concessional loans."" 
	
	
 Linn said that as a result of recent changes in Belgrade, including the Milosevic extradition, ""we will now be talking about Yugoslavia as an integral part of the successful formula of trust for economic recovery in the region."" 
	
	
 Aside from the financial assistance, said Labus, ""this conference is symbolic for us. We are now fully back into the international community, politically, diplomatically and financially, and that's very important for us. 
	
	
 ""We decided to make some bold decisions,"" he said. ""We decided to take the fast track to Europe and implement directly the international rules."" 
	
	
 Labus said Milosevic's extradition ""is of course a part of the equation,"" but added ""broad economic reforms and democracy that we introduced into the country"" had played a major role. 
	
	
 ""The fact that Milosevic is on the way to be brought to justice is just a signal that my country is ready to respect all international obligations."" 
	
	
 Labus recalled that his country was recovering from ""a decade of dramatic economic decline, including trade isolation and sanctions... 
	
	
 ""We are in the middle of a very complicated process of changing almost completely our political and economic system...This process is long and painful, but we are determined to win."" 
	
	
 Infrastructure, including power, water, rail and roads, he said, were ""suffering from many years of decay, mismanagement and the consequences of the NATO 1999 bombing campaign"" that ended Belgrade's repression of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority. 
	
	
 ""A Yugoslavia that has a firm and decisive program of economic reforms in place is and is increasingly integrated into the wider international community is no longer a dream, it is now a reality."" 
	
	
 ""There is no quick fix"" to the Yugoslav problem, the World Bank's Johannes Linn said. ""But the costs of failing to support Yugoslavia as it struggles to break with the past would surely be higher still. 
	
	
 ""The possibility of a democratic, stable and prosperous Yugoslavia moving toward integration with Europe is something which we dared not hope for only eight months ago."" 
	
	
 In Berlin, Bodo Hombach, coordinator of the Balkans Stability Pact, said several delegations to the Brussels conference told him it was now ""easier and more motivating"" to supply Belgrade with the aid it desperately needs. 
	
	
 The Stability Pact was launched two years ago to rebuild the region after years of war and communism.

A cow grazing near the village of Meresti [Harghita County] was bitten by a fox suffering from rabies. As a consequence, the cow was infected as well. This is the first such case here, and the third one since 1999. The symptoms appeared within a few days. The owner though that the animal was suffering from some intoxication, which was confirmed also by the veterinarian called to examine the cow. Very soon, however, the symptoms indicated that it was suffering from rabies: it was banging its head against the crib and it was very restless. The owner put down the animal, although the vet had forbidden him to do so. The latter took the cow's head to a lab, where they found that it had been suffering from rabies. The owner and a neighbor who had helped him put down the animal were sent urgently to the Hospital for Infectious Diseases in Miercurea Ciuc, where they received preventive anti-rabies treatment. The carcass of the cow was burned and buried, and the stable was disinfected.!
 The Harghita County Sanitary and Veterinary Directorate has started an anti-rabies campaign, in which they are to vaccinate more than 70,000 cattle, horses, sheep, and pigs in 22 localities.

Tajikistan: drug-busting hampered by obsolete equipment 
	
	
 Text of report in English by Russian news agency Interfax 
	
	
 Moscow, 5 July: Due to poor technical equipment, Tajikistan seizes only 10 per cent of the drugs transited through its territory from Afghanistan, Director of the Tajik anti-drug agency Rustam Nazarov has said. ""Since our technical equipment is far from perfect, we perhaps seize even less than 10 per cent,"" Nazarov said in an interview with the Thursday edition of Nezavisimaya Gazeta. Out of 2,200 kg of drugs seized this year in Tajikistan, only 837 kg were seized at the border, and the rest inside the country, Nazarov said. ""Our agency seriously needs equipment for detecting drugs,"" he said. ""We do not have special devices for inspecting large automobiles and cargoes,"" Nazarov said, adding that his service does not have enough communications equipment, either.

GATUNA, Rwanda, July 6 (AFP) - President Paul Kagame of Rwanda and his Ugandan counterpart Yoweri Museveni began talks here Friday in a bid to mend soured relations between their neighbouring countries. 
	
	
 The two heads of state met under an canvas awning set up for the occasion a few hundred metres (yards) from the Gatuna border post, an AFP correspondent reported. 
	
	
 The formerly close allies fell out in 1999, the year after each sent troops to back rebel movements in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, when mounting rivalry lead to violent clashes between their own armies there. 
	
	
 Museveni and Kagame have met three times since the fighting broke out in the DRC city of Kisangani, the main town in the northeast of the country, but without patching up their differences. 
	
	
 In March, Uganda declared Rwanda a hostile nation because of tensions arising from Kigali's alleged support for a rival to Museveni in a presidential election. 
	
	
 The two countries have each accused the other of backing dissidents.

[Computer selected and disseminated without FBIS editorial intervention] 
	
	
 Paris, July 11 (CNA) -- Taiwan's economy will become totally dependent on mainland China within the next few years, causing the island to lose control of its own political fate, a French weekly warned Thursday. 
	
	
 The Nouvel Observateur said that Beijing is unlikely to annex Taiwan by force, despite its deployment of missiles along its coastal provinces opposite Taiwan, but is instead resorting to smarter tactics, bringing the Taiwan authorities to heel through Taiwan businessmen who are eager to explore the mainland Chinese market. 
	
	
 The weekly said that mainland China has attracted more than US$50 billion in investment from Taiwan thus far, while the Taipei authorities bowed to pressure from its own businessmen to lift restrictions on investment in mainland China in May, a move expected to speed up the flow of Taiwan capital to its arch rival. 
	
	
 Barring any reversal to the trend, the weekly quoted U.S. magazine Business Weekly as saying that Beijing might bring the island to its knees without firing one bullet. 
	
	
 Another factor which might deter Beijing's military adventurism in the Taiwan Strait is Washington's ""readiness to fight Beijing for Taiwan,"" which will bear witness to Washington's determination to remain a power in Asia, according to the magazine. 
	
	
 The publication quoted Wu Guoguang, a professor at Hong Kong University, as saying that any concessions by Washington on the Taiwan issue could trigger a defection of its Asian allies, including Japan, to Beijing's fold. 
	
	
 But Beijing's leaders are not likely to blink on the issue either because an independent state in Taiwan would boost the schisms in Tibet and Xinjiang and threaten the regime in Beijing, the magazine claimed. 
	
	
 Although there is only scant possibility of a military conflict in the Taiwan Strait, the Nouvel Observateur said, Beijing's military buildup in its southern coastal provinces still makes the region ""the most heavily armed place in the world next only to the Middle East,"" and a dangerous flashpoint in the 21st century.

KINSHASA, July 14 (AFP) - Some 60 representatives of civil society, parties, rebel groups and government in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are to take part in preparatory talks on reviving political dialogue in the vast country next month, an official said Saturday. 
	
	
 A representative of the facilitator of the talks, Hacen Ould Lebatt, told a media conference here that 38 civil society delegates, representing seven of the DRC's 11 provinces, had already been designated. 
	
	
 The round of consultations ahead of the start of formal negotiations between the various parties -- dubbed the ""inter-Congolese dialogue"" -- will begin August 20 in the Botswana capital Gaborone, the facilitator of the talks, former Botswana president Ketumile Masire, announced this week. 
	
	
 Masire's team, which has criss-crossed the former Zaire to prepare for the talks, is currently pursuing its mission in the provinces of Bandundu, Bas-Congo, Equateur, and in the capital Kinshasa, Lebatt said. 
	
	
 Masire said this week he was determined to ""ensure that people from all corners of the country are allowed to express their views"", adding that he wanted to avoid a ""superficial"" exercise. 
	
	
 The national dialogue is a feature of peace accords signed in 1999 by all warring parties in the former Zaire -- two rebel groups, their backers Rwanda and Uganda, and the Kinshasa government and its allies, Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia. 
	
	
 Masire was brought back into the DRC peace process in February this year as facilitator for the inter-Congolese dialogue by President Joseph Kabila. 
	
	
 The young president's father Laurent, assassinated in January, had sidelined Masire after accusing him of being biased in favour of the rebels. 
	
	
 Lebatt told the media conference that deep divergences remained concerning the designation of delegates to represent DRC political parties, and those to represent the parties who signed the Lusaka agreement. 
	
	
 ""The political players must overcome their divisions by finding a formula for consensus,"" said Lebatt, who is former foreign and cooperation minister of Mauritania. 
	
	
 The Lusaka accord merely speaks about ""political opposition"", he said. ""One must ask 'opposition to whom and what?'."" 
	
	
 Lebatt said the facilitation team expected to draw up a final list of participants by August 6. 
	
	
 The conflict in the former Zaire broke out when rebels backed by Laurent Kabila's erstwhile allies Rwanda and Uganda launched an insurgency in August 1998.

Russia favours creation of ""international instruments"" to regulate emissions 
	
	
 Text of report in English by Russian news agency Interfax 
	
	
 Moscow, 16 July: The Russian Foreign Ministry has called for ""taking into account Russia's specific interests"" in working out international documents concerning the regulation of emissions. A Foreign Ministry statement in connection with the opening of a conference of the signatories to the UN framework convention on climate change in Bonn reads that taking into account Russia's interests ""is of vital importance from the viewpoint of prospects for the ratification of the Kyoto protocol inside the state"". Russia is ""interested in creating international instruments for regulating emissions, which will guarantee the stable economic development of all signatories to international agreements on the climate sphere without any exceptions"", the statement reads. ""The US decision to withdraw from introducing state measures to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases negatively affects the world community's efforts to ensure the global and efficient character of the Kyoto protocol,"" the document reads.

Beijing, July 17 (XINHUA)-- DaimlerChrysler AG said Monday that the international recall of Mercedes-Benz luxury cars did not affect vehicle owners in China. 
	
	
 A written statement made by the company's China branch revealed that no glitches had been found in China since its last recall in 1999, Tuesday's China Daily reported. 
	
	
 The Germany-based auto giant recalled 150,000 Mercedes-Benz luxury cars throughout Europe and the Middle East on Friday to fix a defect that could cause the driver's side air bag to deploy prematurely, the newspaper said. 
	
	
 The recall conducted in China in 1999 was purely a precautionary measure and no reports of any incidents in China had been received at that time, China Daily quoted the statement as saying. 
	
	
 The exclusion of China from the recall has led to claims that the firm was biased against Chinese customers. The China Consumers Association said Monday that it had received five complaints of problems related with Benz cars in China, according to China Daily. 
	
	
 The problem was first discovered in March 1996 in Indonesia and led to a November 1999 recall of cars in the United States and Asia, where hot, humid conditions were thought to trigger the air bags.

Taipei, Aug. 17 (CNA) -- The Republic of China [ROC] government will push for Chinese language education among the vast number of Chinese communities in Southeast Asia, a high-ranking ROC official said Friday. 
	
	
 Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission (OCAC) head Chang Fu-mei made the remarks after concluding a symposium on work in the Asia-Pacific Chinese communities. 
	
	
 Chang said after visiting Chinese communities in the United States, New Zealand and Southeast Asia that education and cultural work needs to be further strengthened in the Chinese communities in Southeast Asia. 
	
	
 With the limited funding to which her commission is entitled, Chang said, OCAC will focus its educational and cultural work on Chinese communities with the fewest resources, such as those in Myanmar [Burma], Vietnam and Indonesia. 
	
	
 The minister went on to say that although mainland China is squeezing Taiwan's development space in the world community with its huge resources and strong diplomacy, the ROC can still break through its difficulties as long as it implements democracy and obtains the support of overseas Chinese communities. 
	
	
 A total of 38 overseas Chinese community leaders from nine Asian and Pacific countries attended the symposium, at which the participants also exchanged views on cross-Taiwan Strait relations.

MDC leader Tsvangirai at it again in South Africa 
	
	
 Herald Reporter 
	
	
 OPPOSITION youths are agitating to get guns to ""shoot"" President Mugabe ""out of office,"" MDC leader, Mr Morgan Tsvangirai said in South Africa yesterday. 
	
	
 Speaking in an address to the Cape Town Press club, Mr Tsvangirai, who is on a visit to South Africa, was quoted by Reuters as saying he was having to ""rein in militants keen to fight President Mugabe's rule"". 
	
	
 ""The first choice is to commit ourselves to the constitutional path with all its obstacles. We are saying we will not resort to any violent overthrow or to any violent means,"" he was quoted as having said. 
	
	
 ""...You have people who are 20 years and 30 years (and) below who are asking if we can get guns and go and shoot the man out of office, but I say: Please, that is the most dangerous thing you can ever do,"" he said. 
	
	
 Mr Tsvangirai endorsed a United States proposal for targeted sanctions against President Mugabe and members of his Government but said full economic sanctions would be a ruinous mistake. 
	
	
 The US Congress is set to consider the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Bill, which seeks to impose sanctions on Harare. 
	
	
 Mr Tsvangirai called for international action to ensure a free and fair presidential election. 
	
	
 But he opposed any steps that could plunge the country deeper into a recession that has already pushed unemployment, inflation and interest rates above 60 percent. 
	
	
 ""If sanctions are imposed on Zimbabwe, it will not survive. That is why, as MDC, we are reluctant at this stage to endorse the sanctions option. 
	
	
 ""Until such time as Mugabe actually subverts the electoral process - when one goes to that extreme, international sanctions will be an option. 
	
	
 ""However, we do support certain limitations on the villains of the crisis in Zimbabwe,"" he said. 
	
	
 Mr Tsvangirai might face charges of contravening the Law and Order Maintenance Act for allegedly threatening to violently remove President Mugabe from power last year. 
	
	
 His trial was set to start at the High Court in May but the case was referred to the High Court after he challenged the legality of LOMA in the Supreme Court. 
	
	
 The superior court has since heard State and defence arguments on the legality of the charges being laid against the opposition leader and reserved judgment. 
	
	
 If the Supreme Court rules in favour of Mr Tsvangirai, who if convicted on the charges might face life imprisonment, the Attorney General's Office will have to draw up a new charge. 
	
	
 But if the appeal fails, the matter will be referred back to the High Court for trial. 
	
	
 Charges against the MDC leader arose after he allegedly told a crowd at the party's first anniversary last year that ""... Zvatichada, what we would like to tell Mugabe today is that... please go peacefully. If you don't want to go peacefully, we will remove you violently."" 
	
	
 That according to the State constituted a breach of the LOMA. 
	
	
 The MDC leader also alleged that the Government was trying to provoke protests that could be used as an excuse to suspend democracy. 
	
	
 But analysts expressed concern that the MDC leader is ""flirting with mercenaries in South Africa"". 
	
	
 ""But anyone who wants to speak the language of violence where Zimbabwe is concerned is playing with fire. Zimbabwe's performance in Mozambique, Somalia and the DRC speaks for itself. 
	
	
 ""The quickest defeat of Tsvangirai and his MDC lot would come if they chose the path of violence,"" an analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity said.

 ""Weapons cannot prevent Taiwan from reuniting with China,"" he told Thai and Chinese media last week. 
	
	
 Wang's visit, which will also take in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, comes as pressure mounts on both sides to resume dialogue as Beijing is poised to become a member of the World Trade Organisation next year. 
	
	
 Taiwan will follow suit shortly after. 
	
	
 He said Beijing will maintain its pursuit of peaceful unification with Taiwan and welcomed the resumption of dialogue, bogged down since 1999. 
	
	
 At that time, then president Lee Teng-hui demanded political parity by unilaterally redefining bilateral ties as ""special state-to-state"" relations. 
	
	
 While President Chen Shui-bian has mellowed his stance on independence, he has refused to bow to the ""one-China policy"", a precondition for dialogue. 
	
	
 In his latest speech, Chen said the long-standing dispute with China must be resolved through dialogue with respect to the principles of democracy and freedom. 
	
	
 Nevertheless, Taiwan heightened its diplomatic campaign through what Wang said was ""parliamentarian"" or ""private diplomacy"" to win recognition from Beijing's allies. 
	
	
 Beijing was so worried about the tactic that Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji raised the matter in May with Thai leaders during his official visit to Thailand. He said the number of Thai politicians visiting Taiwan, especially members of Parliament, was increasing at an ""unusual"" rate. 
	
	
 ""We disapproved of these visits because no matter in what capacity these people travel, Taiwan treats them as official visits. To us, parliamentarians still hold a quasi-official status,"" he said. 
	
	
 Taiwanese officials in Bangkok always claimed these trips from Thailand to Taiwan were voluntary and initiated by the visitors themselves. 
	
	
 Wang said Beijing raised no objections to the so-called stop-over tactic used by Taiwanese leaders as long as the visits do not generate political activities in the host country. 
	
	
 Despite a still-tense relationship, Wang is optimistic reunification will eventually happen as was the case with Hong Kong and Macau. He said the decline in President Chen's popularity could be attributed to the drop in the number of people favouring independence. 
	
	
 ""I believe less than 10 per cent of Taiwanese now favour independence,"" he said. 
	
	
 However, according to broad statistics, Taiwan-born voters favouring independence account for 65 per cent of the island's 23 million population. Wang believes unification will benefit people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits. Last year there were 2.85 million Taiwanese visitors in China, he said.

 Seoul, Aug. 29 (Yonhap) -- LG Electronics Co. said Wednesday that it has established a code division multiple access (CDMA) mobile phone service system in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, to begin service on Sept. 1, Uzbekistan's Independence Day. The opening ceremony for the CDMA system was held there Monday with LG Electronics Co. President Park Chung-gun, Uzbek Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy Isaev, Perfect Mobile President Alexey Martinson and other dignitaries attending, an LG spokesman said. LG signed a contract in March for the shipment of the CDMA equipment with Perfect Mobile, which has the exclusive right to do CDMA business in the central Asian state. LG has established 30,000 circuits of 800 Megahertz CDMA system in Tashkent, the Uzbek capital, and is planning to increase the facility to up to 200,000 circuits by 2004. LG also plans to upgrade the current system beginning 2002. President Park said that the opening of the LG CDMA mobile phone service in Uzbekistan will have an impact on neighboring central Asian states. ""We hope that this will serve as an occasion for LG to make inroads into the Central Asian region."" Uzbekistan is the largest country in central Asia with a population of 23 million and rich in natural resources.

Bangkok, Aug. 28 (CNA) -- The Taipei-based Chinese Federation of Labor (CFL) attended the Asian regional meeting of the International Labor Organization (ILO) held Tuesday in Bangkok, mainly because of its work to protect foreign laborers in Taiwan. 
	
	
 CFL President Lin Hui-kuan led the Taiwan delegation to the meeting in the name of observer of the International Confederation of Free Trade Union (ICFTU). It was the first time that a Taiwan labor group has been invited to participate in a meeting of the ILO, which is an affiliate of the United Nations. 
	
	
 The CFL's participation in the meeting did not meet with any objection from Beijing, as it attended as an observer of a non-U.N. organization. Beijing opposes Taiwan's participation in any international organization in which sovereignty is a prerequisite. 
	
	
 Lin told CNA that the CFL gained high appraisal in its efforts to protect the rights of Thai, Filipino, Indonesian and Vietnamese workers in Taiwan. 
	
	
 Taiwan is the only country in Asia that allows foreign laborers to enjoy the same salary levels as their local counterparts, which elevates its image in international society, Lin added. 
	
	
 He indicated that although Taiwan is not a U.N. member, it has signed two international agreements related to labor affairs and abides by all the regulations stipulated by the ILO. 
	
	
 Recently, Lin added, the Republic of China government was about to eliminate the minimum wage requirement for foreign workers mainly due to pressure from the business sector. However, through the protests of local labor groups, foreign laborers' working rights were protected, bringing extra attention to the power of Taiwan labor groups. 
	
	
 Lin noted that Taiwan is one of the ICFTU founders and that its participation in the ILO can serve as a model for Taiwan to take part in international activities. 
	
	
 Lin and his delegation are scheduled to return home Sept. 1 after the quadrennial meeting.

Burundi: Abducted fishermen released by rebels in southwest - agency 
	
	
 Text of report by Burundi news agency Azania 
	
	
 The 28 fishermen who were abducted on Tuesday [28 August] morning in Lake Tanganyika have been released without any ransom being paid. According to reports received from family members in Rumonge [southwestern Burundi], the fishermen were freed by their kidnappers, the FDD-FNL [Forces for the Defence of Democracy-National Liberation Forces] rebels, who had confused the fishermen's boat to be that of the Burundi army.

He says his letter in answer to the antiglobalists' arguments is ""personal,"" but Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt is taking good care that his partners opinions' are being heard, that general considerations alternate with real initiatives, that concessions are sufficiently concrete, and that his letter that will be published this Monday [10 September] will attract worldwide attention. His timing is right. First, his foreign trade minister, Annemie Neyts, has to create the right climate. Today, she will read a declaration on globalization in the European Parliament; later this week she will preside the informal meeting of EU foreign trade ministers in Bruges. During this meeting, she has scheduled a meeting with peaceful antiglobalists, ""but there is little I can do,"" she said in an interview. 
	
	
 ""This is no blind violence but rather targeted violence,"" Annemie Neyts said referring to the antiglobalist movement that set Gothenburg and Genoa, among other cities, ablaze. ""However, the movement is more than that. There are also peaceful protesters. We should listen to them. The current generation, too, is entitled to receive answers. The protest movement is colored by leftist ideology. They thought they had lost the game, and all at once they see an opportunity to resume their ideological fight against capitalism. We should keep listening and arguing, but adopt a cautious approach. In 1968 [Paris student revolt] I was annoyed at politicians who sided with us just to gain popularity."" 
	
	
 Neyts, who has also been presiding the Liberal [free market-oriented] International for two years, spontaneously talks about the 1968 events on several occasions during the interview. ""The current protest movement is still in a phase that we called contestation in 1968. But the protesters are not the only ones who are worried about the gulf between north and south."" 
	
	
 Neyts noticed this while reading the local press in Kenya, where she has recently been on a holiday, and in Morocco. ""All the country's problems are now often attributed to globalization, also country-specific problems such as corruption, for instance."" 
	
	
 Neyts is convinced that gaining access to development is a much more complex phenomenon than is generally accepted. ""It is reassuring to believe that the Tobin tax [on speculative capital movements] will stimulate development, but there is more to it. I think that the development debate does not focus enough on political development and political stability. How do you create political parties? How do you set up an efficient judicial system?"" 
	
	
 Neyts is a resolute defender of world trade and the World Trade Organization (WTO). ""Trade alone will not save the world,"" Neyts said, ""but in as far as it refers to the free exchange of products and movement of persons, it constitutes an important factor for economic development."" 
	
	
 ""In the 1930's, the first reaction to the economic depression was to close all borders. The situation only got worse. Today, we opt for an international cooperation model. There is no alternative to it but conflict, isolation, nationalism, and ultimately war. International cooperation is slow and does not function optimally, but the alternatives are worse."" 
	
	
 The WTO is accused of fostering trade anarchy. This implies that it would totally liberalize trade. The WTO seeks to do exactly the contrary. The WTO issues regulations and penalties in case these regulations are not observed. Moreover, the WTO is a young and small organization, and not a cold monster as some people are depicting it."" 
	
	
 Neyts understands that developing countries may feel uneasy about the kind of trade negotiations that are conducted at WTO level. ""And this is not only a feeling. Out of 140 members, not even 50 percent has a permanent delegation in Geneva. Those countries do not possess the necessary expertise to conduct such highly technical negotiations."" 
	
	
 However, the WTO should not be loaded with all the world's sins. ""There is not one developing country that wants to link social regulations to WTO regulations. They think that this is some sort of new protectionism by the West following the abolishment of tariff barriers (except for agriculture). That is not what it is all about."" 
	
	
 Neyts rejects all forms of violence, but understands the protests. ""Certain excesses at EU meetings and, above all, at 'summits,' the so-called 'high masses,' sometimes call for a reaction. There is an immense gulf between the hype surrounding a summit and its result, which is often worded in illegible conclusions. This is even worse in the case of G-8 meetings. Closing off a zone by means of containers, as was done in Genoa, is an act of objectionable brutality."" 
	
	
 ""Therefore, it is a positive development that all 'summits' will be held in Brussels as of 2003,"" Neyts said. ""This will remove the hype surrounding them."" 
	
	
 However, a clear answer that would silence all protests does not exist. ""We are living in a politically highly sophisticated society. Following the closure of the Renault plant in Vilvoorde, we issued a law known as the Renault law. At the time, the brutality with which this closure was implemented was unheard of, but now we have legal instruments to avoid this."" 
	
	
 ""Unfortunately, Renault's Vilvoorde plant did effectively close down, ""but this is a question of overcapacity in the automobile industry."" According to Neyts, many initiatives to alleviate discontent have recently been taken. ""The Belgian delegation to the WTO negotiations will include nongovernmental organizations. The WTO texts include passages about the need to heed civilian society and to pay attention to durable development."" 
	
	
 ""Actually, I do not know what else we can do. I think that the antiglobalists do not realize what has already been done. Their criticism that we obstruct agricultural products from the south is justified. But this can only change if we negotiate. To do this, regulations and a structure like the WTO are needed. Otherwise, what will happen is that existing trade blocks will grow stronger. The least developed countries will be left behind.""

During the past weeks Europe and America witnessed the arrangement of important international conferences, which could on the one hand guarantee the peace and stability of the world, or could instead deteriorate the conditions. The conference in New York, which dealt with a ban on demand for light arms, and the Genoa Conference which had a much wider and extended agenda, had two common features between them. The first was that large and numerous bodies of dissidents were opposing the wishes and interests of a small but powerful group. The second feature was that both conferences ended without effective result, and the decisions taken and resolutions adopted there lacked conclusiveness and were not operational. The Bonn Conference however, which dealt with the global environment and examined the condition of world climate, could be appraised as an exception and a relative success. 
	
	
 After two weeks of discussion and exchange of views at the New York Conference, it was decided to pay heed to the resolute demands advanced by the majority of the participants, who emphatically insisted on the imposition of a ban on the sale of light weaponry. But paying heed was not tantamount to endorsement of the demand launched by those countries; rather, the final result came out as a compromise solution and a relative back up by the majority group. 
	
	
 The joint demand and stand by the majority of countries attending the conference was encountered by firm opposition by the United States [of America]. American delegates at the conference maintained that any restriction or ban on the sale, possession, and carrying of light armaments was practically the same as limiting the freedom of action [as published] of American citizens, and equal to reducing their margin of security. This is while possessing arms for self-defense is itself a factor that breeds insecurity. Critics of the meeting, on the margin of the conference, up held the view that the American government, instead of heeding the wishes of international community, and protecting the security of world nations, and above all the safety of its own citizens, has paid more attention to the interests of corporations and huge arms producers and military-industrial complexes that reap tremendous profits annually from the sale of such armaments. (It should be noted that the issues moved at the conference were declared unofficial and lacking validity [legal force] even for the participating countries.) [Sentences are as published] The most important of the three conferences, which subsequently gained even more prominence, was the conference in Genova; perhaps even more so for the results ""not obtained"" at the conference, and which led to the subsequent intense dissatisfaction and frustration of the leading industrial states attending the meeting. The governments attending the conference had a long and varied agenda, including: economic globalization, the anti-missile shield defense project, the Kyoto Protocol and environmental protection, the political and military crises in the Middle East, the Balkans, and Afghanistan, moratorium on the accumulated debt of the poor countries, and ... [as published] They meant to reach some form of agreement or understanding about those issues, but unexpected events left all that in limbo and uncertainty. The conference opened with fierce demonstrations by the opponents of economic globalization, who maintained that what is being concocted by globalization is in fact poverty. When Italian police intervened and roughly handled the demonstrations, things got out of hand; the already volatile situation reached boiling point, violent clashes broke out, and the killing of one protestor overshadowed all other issues. The whole incident was in fact unprecedented in the history of European democracies, and has prompted a whole range of controversies and debates. 
	
	
 It can safely be claimed that the events in Genoa have influenced [overshadowed] the very conferences in New York and Bonn; whereas, from the onset, the weak results of Genoa was foreseeable for most observers. Because, from the very start it could be predicted that on the subject of economic globalization, the developed and capitalist states were going to come across fierce opposition by dissident groups and the supporters of economic growth in poor countries. 
	
	
 Regarding the American proposed Anti-Missile Defense System too, neither Russia, China, Japan, nor even the European Union, had shown any enthusiasm; rather they had all expressed their reserves on the project. Concerning the environmental protection issue, the emission of toxic and greenhouse gases, and warming up of the planet earth's climate too, which was somehow related to the [agenda of] Bonn Conference, America had relentlessly demonstrated its paradoxical [as published] [controversial] position and particular stance opposed to that of other developed states by her previous abandonment of the Kyoto Protocol. Whereas, beforehand, it was anticipated and hoped that the agreements reached at Genoa would help bring about beneficial results for the Bonn conference as well. Even the eagerness for playing an intermediary role in the Middle East crisis has given rise to fierce competition between America, European Union, and Russia and China. And it is likely that until each party seeks its own particular interest in the conflict, and until the rivalry persists, the question would continue to remain unresolved. 
	
	
 What, however, was most remarkable in the conferences in New York and Genoa, was the fact that most decisions made, were based on interests and tastes of particular groups [lobbies]. Here are the views expressed by two of the prominent characters attending the Genoa Conference. Jacques Chirac, the French President, responding to the protests leveled by opponents of globalization, had said: ""They have no right to present themselves as defenders of the world poor..."" Similarly, Gerhard Schroeder, the German Chancellor, too had claimed that the participants at the summit meeting were the true, legitimate, and elected representatives of the people of their countries. In the remarks made by these political leaders, one point is interesting and calls for reflection: if these leaders reject the interference of others in the condition and destiny of the poor nations, while present themselves legitimate and competent to make far reaching decisions for them, then it must be said that they are only the elected [leaders] of their own nation [people], and this does not entitle them to act as representative or legal attorney of all people worldwide! [Exclamation mark as published] In view of the criticisms, which have been made, they could perhaps be also considered to be the representative of powerful corporations that have placed the whole ""world economy"" under their influence, and as a result of that they are also controlling the world of politics globally. 
	
	
 At the Bonn Conference too, the agenda was to tackle and discuss the most urgent and indispensable factors concerning the life of humankind. The remarkable feature of this conference was the joint resolution adopted by 180 countries worldwide --- in regard to protection of environment, and above all reducing the emission of greenhouse gases ---, which has isolated America in an undeniable way. It was due to this isolation that America, in spite of discrediting [undermining] the Kyoto Protocol and declining to comply with the Bonn Conference [resolution], was forced to at least make a promise to cooperate in preventing an increase in air pollution. 
	
	
 To recap, if there ever existed any possibility that at the conferences of New York and Genoa questions regarding: promotion of world security, improvement of economic conditions, defusing regional and global crises and conflicts, checking unleashed competition for rearmament, reduction of the gap between the mainstream and peripheral countries, and ... could be addressed and appropriate, serious, and worthy measures for their solution could be adopted, the opportunity was very easily lost and the meetings flopped completely. As regards the recent conference (Bonn Meeting), although the past gatherings like the Hague meeting and Kyoto conference have proved to be failed experiences, nevertheless as the climatic and atmospheric crises are growing more serious, one can be optimistic and hopeful about the success of such protocols and pacts, and implementation of the agreements, even though they are not protected by any sanctions.

VIENNA, Sept 6 (AFP) - The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe agreed Thursday [6 September] to send 25 additional monitors in Macedonia, joining the 26 observers working to prevent a new Balkans war in the republic. 
	
	
 OSCE ambassadors from the organisation's 55 member states agreed to send the additional monitors after Russia lifted its objections to the beefed up presence. 
	
	
 Russia had slowed the decision, which was expected to have been announced a week before, raising concerns about their mandate in contrast with that of the NATO mission to collect weapons from ethnic Albanian rebels. 
	
	
 Macedonia has asked for more monitors, hoping they would help stop the country plunging into civil war between ethnic Albanian guerrillas and the Slav majority of the population. 
	
	
 NATO has entered Macedonia to collect weapons from the guerrillas, but its 30-day mission is due to end on September 26. That means Macedonia's stability will depend on other organisations, including the OSCE. 
	
	
 But the monitors' mandate, established in 1992, only includes surveying the security situation and the return of refugees, an OSCE official said. 
	
	
 The permanent council is still to adopt a new mandate which would make the OSCE, among others, responsible for training a new Macedonian police force, helping to organise a census and new elections, he added. 
	
	
 ""In the meantime, doubling the number of monitors should help put people's minds at ease,"" he said. 
	
	
 The OSCE comprises 55 states in Europe, central Asia, the United States and Canada. Monitors have been present in Macedonia for some years alongside European Union observers.

Dushanbe meeting discusses helping Afghan northern Alliance

 The tragic and shocking events that shook the United States, destroying a number of its economic, urban, and military landmarks, have aroused grief and sorrow worldwide. This is because the terrorist violence has struck innocent women and children and defenseless civilians. The scenes of destruction reminded the Palestinian people of the ongoing devastation and the Palestinians who are falling victim to the Israeli acts of bombardment, targeted assassinations, and incursions into Palestinian towns and villages, including Bayt Jala, Gaza, Khan Yunus, Rafah, Janin, Tulkarm, Ramlallah, Jericho, Nabulus, and others. 
	
	
 Nobody who has a live conscience and human feelings, whether he is Palestinian or otherwise, could not have been moved by these events and expressed sympathy for the families of the US victims, regardless of the US political stances that are totally biased to Israel and Israel's use of the most advanced US weapons to curb the Palestinian intifadah. This is because the Palestinians were, and still are, hoping that the Americans would realize, if they have not already realized, the justice of the Palestinian cause and the enormous injustice suffered by the Palestinians, who were expelled from their homeland, whose land was occupied, and who were deprived of the minimum political and human rights. 
	
	
 If any people are going to be moved by the scenes of destruction that involved Manhattan, the World Trade Center, and the Pentagon, it is the Palestinian people. These people saw the majority of their security sites destroyed and the residential neighborhoods and apartment buildings parallel to the combat lines with the Israeli army and settlements in the West Bank and Gaza targeted by the Apaches helicopters and large-caliber artillery and machine guns. 
	
	
 However, for Israel to take advantage of the US tragedy to claim that it is standing in one ditch with the United States against the violence of terrorism, this is a twisted logic. This is because Israel is an occupation state, one that is persecuting the Palestinians and denying them the right to exercise their national and sovereign rights. Such a comparison would be theoretically valid if Israel withdrew from the occupied territories but the violence of terrorism against it continued. 
	
	
 While the world is busy following the news of the attacks on the US targets and feeling sorry for these acts, Israel carried out an incursion into Janin and the neighboring villages, bombarded more Palestinian internal security sites, demolished more homes in East Jerusalem, and killed an additional number of Palestinian activists and non-activists, including an 11-year-old girl. 
	
	
 It is very important for the United States to realize the difference between the US and Israeli cases. The Palestinians want nothing from Washington but to understand their cause and stand beside right and justice. What is required of Israel is to withdraw, both on the military and settlement fronts, from the territories occupied in 1967, and the United States should push its ally Israel in that direction. This would put an end to sensitivities, hatred, and injustice and spread peace in the region and the world.

MADRID, Sept 14 (AFP) -- Interpol on Friday released previously confidential search warrants with vital details about the life and activities of Usamah bin-Ladin, the main suspect in Tuesday's deadly attacks in the United States. 
	
	
 The two warrants -- from 1998 and 2000 -- were released at a press conference here by Interpol President Jesus Espigares of Spain and Secretary General Ronald K. Noble of the United States. 
	
	
 The 1998 warrant charged that Bin-Ladin, a Saudi billionaire housed as a ""guest"" in Afghanistan, was involved in the 1994 murder of two Germans in Syrte, Libya. The file said that Libya had demanded his extradition. 
	
	
 The other warrant, from April 4, 2000, was drafted at the request of the US Government and includes a detailed description of the man who tops the US Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) most wanted list. 
	
	
 It includes everything from biographical information -- Bin-Ladin was born March 10, 1957 in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, -- to a physical description -- black hair, brown eyes, 1.96 meters (6 feet, 4 inches) tall and about 67 kilograms (148 pounds) -- to the various aliases he uses. 
	
	
 ""He may walk with a cane,"" the study says, noting that he speaks Arabic and ""Southwest Asian countries and the Middle East are the places where he may travel around."" 
	
	
 The study also notes that the United States offered five million dollars (5.4 million euros) to anyone who had information that could lead to Bin-Ladin's arrest. 
	
	
 Espigares and Noble also said that Interpol has created a task force, named ""September 11,"" after the date on which two hijacked airplanes crashed into the World Trade Center in New York City and another hit the Pentagon in Washington, leaving thousands dead. 
	
	
 The force, based in Lyon, France, will work non-stop to ""help to filter any information coming from Interpol country members,"" Noble said. 
	
	
 Interpol will meet in Budapest from September 24-29, where member countries will discuss methods of bringing those responsible for the attacks to justice, Espigares and Noble said. 
	
	
 US authorities have asked Interpol to organize a police team specialized in identifying victims, they said, refusing to comment further on the status of Interpol's collaboration, saying, ""We do not want to do anything which could undermine FBI investigations."" 
	
	
 ""There are moments in every nation's history which are marked forever. For me, for my country, it's the death of President (John F.) Kennedy. For Spain, (it's) the military forces attacking democracy. But for the world, September 11 is a day that will mark the entire world,"" Noble said.

COLOMBO, Sept 16 (AFP) - Tamil Tiger rebels launched a flotilla of boats to attack a ferry carrying 1,200 troops in northern Sri Lanka Sunday, hours after an explosive-laden boat tried to ram a navy gunboat in a suicide mission, the defence ministry said. 
	
	
 A cluster of at least 20 boats of the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) mounted the pre-dawn attack on the MV Pride of South off the island's Point Pedro coast, ministry spokesman Sanath Karunaratne said. 
	
	
 He said navy gunboats and helicopter gunships repulsed the initial attack and first reports indicated at least two rebel craft had been blown out of the water. There were no immediate reports of casualties. 
	
	
 Fighting continued two hours after the initial exchange of fire in high seas and the navy had called in more gun ships to beat back the guerrillas, Karunaratne said. 
	
	
 ""The ship had been about 26 miles (42 kilometres) away from Point Pedro when the attack started,"" Karunaratne said. ""There are no casualties among the security forces at the moment."" 
	
	
 He said the ship was a regular ferry transporting troops from the northeastern port of Trincomalee to the northern peninsula of Jaffna. There were 1,200 soldiers aboard the ferry. 
	
	
 Hours before the ferry incident, a navy fast attack craft encountered an explosive-laden boat which blew up in an apparent Tamil Tiger suicide mission, Karunaratne said. 
	
	
 The navy craft had approached the small boat thinking it was in distress as an elderly man, a teenager and another person onboard had put up a white flag. 
	
	
 As it neared the boat, it came under attack. When the navy vessel retaliated, the fishing boat exploded. 
	
	
 ""All three people onboard that boat evaporated, indicating that it was packed with explosives to ram against the navy fast attack craft,"" Karunaratne said. 
	
	
 The navy vessel escaped serious damage or casualties. 
	
	
 Tiger guerrillas, leading a campaign for an independent homeland in the island's northeast, have carried out several attacks against navy and merchant ships, including using boats carrying suicide bombers on more than a dozen naval craft. 
	
	
 The LTTE staged a kamikaze-style assault on a merchant vessel in June last year. 
	
	
 An explosives-laden boat rammed into the bulk cargo carrier, MV Mercs Uhana, as it approached the Jaffna peninsula carrying food and other essentials to the embattled region. 
	
	
 Twenty-one crewmen were rescued, but another seven went missing after the attack. 
	
	
 In September 1999, the Sri Lankan navy fought Tiger rebel boats off the island's northeastern coast to prevent the guerrillas from seizing a Chinese merchant vessel. 
	
	
 A Tiger flotilla had been moving towards the 14,000-tonne MV Yugi when it was confronted by navy gun boats, the defence ministry said at the time, adding that the 32 crew members had not been hurt. 
	
	
 The Tigers in August 1997 seized the 6,000-tonne MV Princess Kash off Mullaitivu, on the northeastern coast, while the vessel was taking supplies to private traders in the Jaffna peninsula. 
	
	
 Government forces as well as civilians depend on a vital sea route to Jaffna to provide them with supplies since the land route is held by the Tiger rebels. 
	
	
 Merchant vessels have been warned to operate several miles off the coast to prevent being detected by rebels along the northeastern seaboard. The navy takes the same route when transporting weapons and troops to Jaffna.

GABORONE Sept 17 Sapa SADC, USAID SIGN DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS 
	
	
 Executive secretary of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Prega Ramsamy and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) on Monday signed dollar-based agreements to up American aid to SADC in three areas. 
	
	
 In rand-terms, an additional R7,77-million was committed for drought relief to bring the total to R44-million; R6,48-million to support the objective of achieving an integrated regional market in southern Africa, bringing the total committed to R189-million; and R898560 in support of strengthening regional economies through non governmental organisations, bringing the total committed to the programme to R88,99-million. 
	
	
 The three programmes are virtually open ended, being topped up as projects finish and others are initiated. ""This signing sends a message to SADC of the importance with which the new US administration views regional integration in southern Africa,"" US ambassador to Botswana John Lange, who is also the special representative of the US government to SADC, said. ""It is US policy to continue this type of cooperation."" 
	
	
 Ramsamy also condemned last Tuesday's terror attacks in the United States. ""The SADC secretariat condemns unreservedly and in the strongest terms this act of terrorism,"" he said. Replying, Lange said: ""The day September 11, 2001 has become one of the worst days in American history. ""It was not only an attack on our global village, but the foundations of democracy. We are grateful for the strong support expressed by the international community, particularly the SADC member states."" 
	
	
 Ramsamy also read a joint statement made on Thursday at the close of a meeting of SADC foreign and finance ministers in Blantyre, Malawi, labelling the terror attacks ghastly and barbaric. ""We learnt of the attacks with great shock and sorrow,"" the ministers said. ""We strongly condemn this ghastly and barbaric act of terrorism and wanton destruction of property and the loss of innocent lives. The people of the US are known for their strong sense of justice which will no doubt see them through this trying time and bring the culprits to book."" 
	
	
 The 14 members of SADC are: Angola, Botswana, Democratic Congo, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe.

SOFIA, Sept 26 (AFP) - A Bulgarian businessman claimed Wednesday that aides to Osama bin Laden approached him in April to try to purchase spent nuclear fuel from a Bulgarian plant and that he met with the Saudi dissident. 
	
	
 The businessman, who identified himself as Ivan Ivanov and has worked in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates, told AFP that a group of Pakistani nationals introduced him to bin Laden, the prime suspect in the US terrorist attacks, on April 10 in Peshawar. 
	
	
 A young Arab chemical engineer contacted him the next day, he said, to ask him to act as an intermediary in the sale of the nuclear fuel from the Kozlodui nuclear power plant. 
	
	
 The businessman said he turned down an offer of a 200,000 dollar commission for the sale. 
	
	
 The head of the nuclear energy department at Bulgaria's energy agency separately said he could not imagine a terrorist organisation making a bomb out of products from the reactors at the Kozlodui power station. 
	
	
 ""There is no possibility of legally selling the nuclear waste. They are stockpiled in a secure depot located inside the power station before being sent to Russia to be processed,"" said Anton Ivanov.

 Taipei, Sept. 26 (CNA) -- It is unlikely that the Vatican will establish diplomatic ties with mainland China any time soon, judging from their differences on religious issues, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokeswoman Chang Siao-yue said Wednesday. 
	
	
 Chang's remark came in response to a foreign wire report that mainland China and the Vatican are preparing to bridge their differences and may even pave the way for full diplomatic relations. 
	
	
 Beijing authorities are expected to take advantage of a large religious meeting slated for October 14 in Beijing to develop the possibility of setting up formal relations with the Vatican, according to the report. 
	
	
 In response, Chang said the Beijing leadership will have chances to boost exchanges with Holy See officials in the next few weeks, including in the religious meeting to be held Oct. 14-18 in Beijing and another one scheduled for Oct. 24-25 in Rome. 
	
	
 In addition to Catholic scholars from around the world, former Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti will also take part in the symposium to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the start of Italian Jesuit Matteo Ricci's mission to China in 1601, Chang noted. 
	
	
 The MOFA spokeswoman affirmed that from the angle of Eastern and Western cultural exchanges, the sponsoring of similar conferences will be instrumental to mainland Chinese people's better understanding of Catholicism and its contributions to Chinese society. 
	
	
 As for the development of diplomatic relations between mainland China and the Vatican, Chang noted that differences between the Beijing leadership and the Holy See on religious issues dates from long ago, so it is impossible for the Vatican to broach this issue with Beijing for the time being. 
	
	
 Chang also reaffirmed the solid and cordial diplomatic links between the Republic of China and the Vatican.

TAIPEI, Sept 26 (AFP) -- Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian on Wednesday reiterated Taipei's full support for the United States as Washington prepared to launch reprisals against Afghanistan. 
	
	
 ""On behalf of the government and people of the Republic of China (Taiwan's official name), I would like to extend our full support to the George W. Bush administration in its any decision and act against terrorists,"" Chen said while meeting Oregon governor John Kitzhaber. 
	
	
 Taiwan ""would not stand idly by"" because ""the attacks were not only a challenge to the US but also a disruption of peace for mankind,"" Chen said in a statement released by the presidential office. 
	
	
 ""The ROC government will be with the US government firmly."" 
	
	
 Chen again voiced his condolences to the families of the thousands of Americans killed when hijacked planes plunged into the New York World Trade Center and Pentagon on September 11. 
	
	
 Chen's remarks came as the US was massing forces to launch reprisals against Afghanistan, where the prime suspect Usama bin Laden is believed to be in hiding. 
	
	
 Taiwan's Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao had vowed to back the US in fighting terrorism saying Taiwan had ""no option"" but to do so, despite a lack of diplomatic ties between Taipei and Washington. 
	
	
 Since his inauguration last year, Bush has backpedalled from his predecessor Bill Clinton's policy of engagement with China. 
	
	
 In April Bush approved the biggest US arms package to Taiwan since 1992. 
	
	
 Washington has remained the biggest arms supplier to Taiwan despite switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.

Leaders of the United States probably withheld their breath Monday evening while watching on television what Russian President Vladimir Putin was about to say to his people. After Putin's statement they rubbed their palms at length. It amounted to much more than what one could have expected. The military great power that towers over Afghanistan has committed itself to overthrow the ruling Taliban system, and has pledged to support the US ""anti-terrorism military operation"" now being prepared. Putin has exceeded the ""positive neutrality policy"" his country (the Soviet Union at the time) has pursued during the Gulf War, and whose continued validity the military leaders also regarded as desirable. The situation in which Putin has agreed to open former Soviet military airfields to American armed forces in three (former Soviet) Central Asian countries could be regarded as dramatic. These countries are Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Although these are sovereign states, and the final decision would have been in their hands, people familiar with the actual balance of power indicate that these states would have done nothing, had Moscow wanted a different thing to happen. 
	
	
 One cannot underestimate the significance of the fact that Russia has opened its airspace. True, Putin only permitted (Americans) to deliver via Russian airspace aid to the ""theater of the anti-terrorism military operations,"" (i.e. not soldiers and weapons). Nevertheless, this amounts to such high degree of Russian-American cooperation in a wartime situation, the two sides have never attained during the past 10 years. And Putin has established the prospect of taking further steps in this regard. 
	
	
 Accordingly, Russia has joined the anti-terrorist coalition of the United States virtually without reservation. Putin has written the name of Moscow on the registration page of the American side. He wanted to become an ally, and that's what he has become. But making this complex decision was not easy for him. Reformers told Putin all along that he should take advantage of ""the rare opportunity for (Russia) to become integrated with the civilized world."" But main stream Russian military policy has been to keep a distance from America, the country that has been historically responsible for ""educating"" the Taliban that had caused the demise of Soviet occupation forces in Afghanistan. In the end, a certain consideration that differed from the above two proved to be decisive. It had to do with Chechnya. Putin has no greater desire than to present to the West the Chechen independence movement as a chapter of ""international terror."" He did not succeed with that so far. He was criticized more than recognized for his policy. At this time however, he taught a lesson to the Americans. After the Americans had promised everything good and nice, Putin remarked almost as an aside that the events in Chechnia ""could be interpreted only in the context of the struggle against international terrorism."" In reality, Putin asked for a free hand regarding Chechnia, some understanding, or even that the Americans look the other way. Putin did not receive what he sought in a quick response from Washington, namely, that the State Department would continue to encourage political dialogue between Moscow and the Chechen insurgents. Nevertheless, one could not fail taking note of the fact that in the same response the United States called upon the Chechens to ""unconditionally and without delay to terminate every contact with international terrorist groups,"" and that they accept Putin's offer to make peace. If we view this warning against the background that Putin's government has always seen Usama Bin Ladin's hands behind ""Chechen terrorism,"" we were witnessing a late recognition of Moscow's views. 
	
	
 The Russian President has understood this American recognition. In Berlin, where he was the center of stormy celebration, he vindicated for himself the deeper truth that may be seen behind terror. He argued that had the West not continued to keep alive during the past several years the Cold War stereotype of a threat from the East, but would have concentrated instead on terrorism, the common enemy, the twin towers of New York may not have collapsed. ""Accordingly, at this time it is your turn to think,"" Putin said. Feeling like a true ally, he was able to ask for a place for Russia almost inconspicuously - in NATO. This would have been a joke only yesterday. Today, at the threshold of expansion, it is no longer a joke.

TAIPEI, Sept 27 (AFP) -- Taiwan is expected to officially become a full member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in March 2002, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Steve Chen said Thursday. 
	
	
 ""March appears to be a more reasonable estimate while earlier admission cannot be entirely ruled out,"" according to Chen, also Taiwan's chief WTO negotiator. 
	
	
 After having secured the approval of a working panel in Geneva, Taiwan's entry has yet to be ratified at the WTO's ministerial meeting set for Qatar in November and then undergo parliamentary deliberation at home, he said. 
	
	
 Chen said Taiwan is set to reduce the average tariff rate on 1,021 farm products to 12.9 percent after its WTO accession from 20.0 percent currently. 
	
	
 ""We will also phase out internal protection of such products and remove export subsidies."" 
	
	
 At the same time, the average tariff rate on 3,470 industrial items would be slashed to 4.2 percent eventually from the current 6.0 percent, he added. 
	
	
 Under a quota system, the tariffs on imported cars would be reduced from 30.0 percent in the first year after Taiwan's WTO entry to 17.5 percent in 10 years, he said. 
	
	
 Chen said Taiwan's external trade has less of a need to readjust itself in the post-WTO era as it has long functioned under a market-oriented economy and already largely conforms to international conventions. 
	
	
 Taiwan-made products stood a good chance of becoming even more competitive thanks to wider access to overseas markets and lower costs for material imports, he said. 
	
	
 However an expected increase in farm imports would certainly have an impact on the domestic agricultural sector, he said. 
	
	
 The vice minister said Taiwan's service industry was unlikely to sustain an excessive impact as it has been largely opened to private and foreign participation. 
	
	
 Instead, service ventures in the financial, transport and telecom sectors should benefit from the introduction of advanced skills and expertise from abroad, he added.

BEIJING, Sept 27 (AFP) - China has arrested a number of suspected separatists in its territory bordering Afghanistan and Pakistan as part of a security clampdown ahead of possible US military strikes in the region, local officials said Thursday. 
	
	
 Large numbers of People's Liberation Army troops have also been seen on the move in the Muslim-majority region of Xinjiang, to the far west of China, they said. 
	
	
 ""Many people have been arrested in the past weeks, including suspected separatists and criminals,"" said an official at the minority religious affairs bureau in Kashgar, Xinjiang, China's furthest west city. 
	
	
 ""Public sentencing rallies have been going on in many counties around Kashgar,"" the official, who identified himself only as Yakefu, told AFP. 
	
	
 He also said increasing troop movements had been seen at night around Kashgar, but was unsure where they were going or what their orders were. 
	
	
 Another official said Thursday the main expert on Xinjiang from the US embassy in Beijing had been dispatched to the region to discuss regional attitudes to the devastating terror attacks on the US two weeks ago and to Afganistan's ruling ultra-Islamic Taliban regime. 
	
	
 Diplomat Arthur Marquardt arrived in Kashgar on Saturday and left Wednesday for the provincial capital of Urumqi, said Dong Jianhua at the Kashgar foreign affairs bureau. 
	
	
 Marquardt held separate meetings with police, the minority religious affairs office and other departments, she said. 
	
	
 ""They were talking about China's 'development of the West' program, China's policies on minority nationalities, our opinions on the September 11 attack and the Taliban forces,"" she said. 
	
	
 China has been keeping a particularly close eye on the situation in Xinjiang as expectation mounts the US will launch military action against Afghanistan, home to the suspected mastermind of the terror attacks, Osama bin Laden [Usama Bin Ladin]. 
	
	
 Foreign ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said Tuesday China would take ""all necessary measures"" to ensure the stability of its border regions ahead of any US retaliatory strikes. 
	
	
 Authorities are only too aware that Kashgar is 4,000 kilometres (2,500 miles) from Beijing but only a tenth of the distance from the Pakistani border, and are desperate to ensure instability or militancy does not leak over the frontiers. 
	
	
 There have been a series of bomb blasts in recent years in Urumqi and Beijing, linked to Xinjiang separatists seeking to establish an independent state of East Turkistan. 
	
	
 However Dong of the Kashgar foreign affairs bureau said the security clampdown was usual, and linked to next week's national day holiday. 
	
	
 ""This crackdown is very normal, we always do these things every year before public holidays,"" she said. 
	
	
 She stressed the atmosphere in Kashgar, an ancient city along the historic Silk Road, was peaceful, although tourism and border trade in the region had been affected by the security situation. 
	
	
 ""Many tour groups have been cancelled, so the region's tourism has been affected,"" she said. 
	
	
 In neighboring Hetian city, a hotbed of Muslim separatists in the impoverished southern part of Xinjiang that also borders Pakistan, the situation was also ""peaceful"", said an official at the city's foreign affairs office.

The Nippon Foundation revealed that the number of pirates in Southeast Asia attacking ships for ransom is on rise. During the past several years, pirate attacks have shifted from a ""syndicated"" crime of attacking large cargo ships to a minor crime of theft or robbery. However, the foundation warned that the number of pirate attacks, in the new form of sea jacking ships for ransom, has been increasing. 
	
	
 According to the International Maritime Bureau, a civic organ which acts on reports of suspicious shipping movements, piracy, and armed robbery at sea anywhere in the world, the number of pirate attacks in the first half of this year stood 165, exceeding the record high of 161 pirate attacks in 2000. Ninety of the attacks, approximately half of attacks that took place in the world, were reported in Southeast Asian waters. 
	
	
 The most prominent form of such attacks is sea jack for ransom. In April, in waters off Sumatra Island, an armed group ambushed a cruise ship. Involved were two employees, of a local company that had merged with an established Japanese oil-related company, and an Indonesian state-run company. 
	
	
 In June, six cases of pirate attacks took place in one day in waters near northern island of Borneo, in which trawl-boats and lumber carriers were ambushed. In addition, an Indonesian-registered ship was attacked and the crews from two ships, including a captain, were kidnapped and held for ransom. 
	
	
 Among the eight attacks noted above, it was confirmed that a ransom payment was made in five of the cases. However, negotiations about ransom were not disclosed. Yoshihiko Yamada, domestic division chief of Nippon Foundation's Department of Marine Affairs said, ""There were very few piracy attacks for ransom on commercial vessels. A prevailing view is that these piracy attacks are actually committed by anti-government guerrillas amidst mounting political unrest.""

On the afternoon of August 29, after several delays due to various causes, Japan successfully launched its H2A rocket No. 1 into space from Tanegashima Space Center. This milestone puts Japan's aerospace development program back on track. 
	
	
 The carrier rocket is the foundation of space exploration and utilization. It is also the first hurdle to overcome to realize any astronautical program. Japan previously developed the L and M series of launch vehicles. However, these two rockets are primarily used to launch low orbit satellites. In order to launch large stationary satellites, Japan developed the H series rocket. The major performance characteristics of the H series rocket are comparable to those developed by the United States and some European nations. The Japanese aerospace community takes a great deal of pride in this achievement. 
	
	
 In order to compete with the United States, Europe, and China, Japan decided to drastically reduce its costs, especially in every aspect of rocket design and manufacture. It adopted the simplest design and implemented various cost-cutting measures in an attempt to lower the manufacturing cost per satellite from 19 billion yen to 9 billion yen. It is supposed to be the next generation rocket that is both inexpensive and highly reliable. However, things did not go according to plan. This low cost approach brought about a series of satellite launch failures. In November 1999, a ""multi-purpose"" satellite was launched by H2 rocket No. 8. It did not enter its predetermined orbit and had to be destroyed. This was the third failure in a row. After this incident, Japan began to redesign the main engine of the H2 rocket. Eventually, the H2A rocket was developed. 
	
	
 In addition to carrier rockets, Japan also invested heavily in the development and utilization of various satellite technologies. Japan wishes to build a $21 billion per year aerospace industry centered on commercial satellite development. In the field of satellite communications, Japan's National Space Development Agency (NASDA) spent $310 million to develop the ETS-8 (Engineering Test Satellite 8) satellite. This satellite doubled the capacity of the test satellite previously launched by Japan. This program not only puts Japan in the lead in providing new mobile communication services in the Asia-Pacific region, but also allows Japan to test some new satellite communication techniques to be introduced worldwide. A Japanese made H2A rocket will launch this satellite in 2002. 
	
	
 Military surveillance satellites are also included in its development plan. Japan has prepared a military space program and allocated $1.3 billion to implement it. It will create a military surveillance satellite system consisting of two optical satellites and two radar satellites. 
	
	
 Japan also has a huge space power plant plan. It proposes to construct a gigantic solar power plant in space. The power generated will then converted to microwaves to be received by microwave receiver stations on earth. It is then converted back to electricity. In addition, it also plans to develop 12 satellites, a new generation of unmanned space lab, a space station supply system, and a space shuttle in the next 5 years. 
	
	
 In the past decade, despite its stagnating economy, Japan has still put space exploration as a top priority item in its space program. The Japanese aerospace industry has an ambitious plan to explore the planets. Its first target is the moon. Presently, Japan is implementing these plans in different stages. ""Lunar A,"" one of the major projects, is aimed at delivering two penetrators on the moon to collect various data. One will be located near the landing site of Apollo 14 and the other near a ring-shaped mountain range on the dark side of the moon. ""Selene,"" a project that has a $200 million price tag, will be launched in 2003. It is comprised of two lunar orbiters and a soft landing spacecraft. The soft-landing vehicle will be responsible for data collection and transmission back to earth for further processing. 
	
	
 Japan is determined to become a major power in aerospace. It is its national policy. It is also the path to becoming a major military power. Between 1970 and the end of 1999, Japan launched a total of 66 satellites. In terms of quantity, it is only behind the United States and Russia. In addition, it also takes part in the international space station project and has developed its own astronauts. Japan also has a relatively strong aerospace industry. In 1998, its revenue was 1.1 trillion yen, which represents a 10.5 percent market share worldwide. 
	
	
 After two years of stalemate, the Japanese government recently reorganized its aerospace development agency. Furthermore, it set priorities for the next five years. They include a spy satellite, a data relay satellite to transfer data between satellites, an unmanned universe lab system, a test satellite for communications and broadcasting, an observation satellite for environmental protection, ""Kibo"" the Japanese experimental module of the space station and its supply system, and the H2A carrier rocket to launch all the spacecraft mentioned earlier. By 2010, Japan will increase its global market share in aerospace to 17.4 percent. This is the goal set by the Japanese.

Military violence constitutes -- in very exceptional circumstances -- a necessary evil in this very imperfect world. That is a bitter pill to swallow in a thoroughly non-militaristic society such as ours, where the clash of weapons provokes healthy reactions of repulsion. But unfortunately there is little one can do about it. Without armed violence the Nazi regime and similar forces that had the wind in their sails in Europe in the 1930s, would not have fallen. In the battle against the new forms of terrorism that reached a tragic culmination on 11 September, a limited form of military violence could also not be ruled out. 
	
	
 The many and often confusing reports we have received over recent weeks on who may be responsible for the attacks already allows a clear pattern to be detected. The network with which Usama Bin Ladin and his followers tried to destroy the very foundations of the West has ramifications worldwide, vast amounts of money, and thanks to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan also a number of excellent training and attack bases. The fight against the new, transnational terrorism requires an exceptionally broad and committed strategy. But to build this strategy, targeted attacks on the infrastructure available to Bin Ladin were necessary. 
	
	
 The United States and its principal allies have acted with exceptional caution over recent weeks to the unbelievable provocation of the 11 September attacks. They took pains to build a broad coalition, and tried to make it clear to their own population and the international community that the enemy is not Islam but a very well defined and perverse interpretation of this religion. And they placed the stress on the battle of endurance that must follow. 
	
	
 The attacks on targets in Afghanistan that began yesterday [7 October], remain a risky enterprise. The coming days will reveal whether or not they were effective, were sufficiently precisely targeted and limited in scope. That is a clear condition for this first, unavoidable phase in the battle against terrorism to be humanly acceptable. But they cannot be any real talk of success until the broad strategy against terrorism begins to bear fruit. A strategy that worldwide must include both a degree of repression but most importantly constructive and positive measures. 
	
	
 Whatever the case, we are entering a difficult period. There is a real danger that the wounded but not yet eliminated network will play its ""trump card"" and commit further acts of terrorism. The economic impact of the 11 September attacks was already disastrous, with clear effects on the world economy, hitting the poorest countries by far the most. The whole operation against terrorism can have positive but also unintentionally negative effects on the international stage. But we had no choice. To have sat back with arms folded would have made us all hostages.

Taipei, Oct. 8 (CNA) -- The United States military action in Afghanistan will help spur global investment sentiment by brushing aside many uncertain factors, Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Chairman Chen Po-chih said Monday. 
	
	
 Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, investors across the world have been mired in uncertainties, Chen said, adding that should the war against Afghanistan not spread too much, the impact on the global economy will be limited. 
	
	
 The CEPD head, however, pointed out that it is still too early to comment to what extent the war would affect the local economy now that it is impossible for it to regain momentum by the end of this year. 
	
	
 Wu Hui-lin, a researcher at Change Hua Institution for Economic Research, however, predicted that business conditions in the world market would rebound very robustly in the short term, as the new hi-tech war will not last long and ""high-risks will bring about high investment returns."" Wu said optimistically that ""it is unnecessary to wait until next year for the recovery to take place"" on the ground that ""vast damage will produce opportunities for construction."" Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks against the United States, countries across the world have been closely monitoring subsequent developments and have taken measures to cope with possible situations, Wu said, noting that short-term pains will eventually pass and everyday life will get back to normal soon.

The PRL [Liberal Reform Party] and the PSC [Christian Social Party] opposition party continue to support the strikes but criticize the fact that the humanitarian operations are taking place alongside them. Ecolo and Agalev [ecologist parties] are asking for the ending of the bombing of Afghanistan. For the PS [Socialist Party], Senator Jean Cornil still supports them, while being increasingly critical. Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt has announced on Flemish television that Europe will discuss the American actions in Afghanistan next Friday [19 October] in Gent [northwest of Brussels] during the informal [EU] heads of state and government summit.

SHANGHAI, Oct 16 (AFP) - Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar warned Tuesday that prolonged military attacks on Afghanistan could destabilise the Islamic world and reiterated calls for the US to end the campaign quickly. 
	
	
 ""We hope it can be ended as soon as possible,"" Syed Hamid told AFP in an interview here ahead of a ministerial gathering of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. 
	
	
 ""If it goes on, we are worried. Islamic countries are with the US in combatting terrorism but we don't want it to be prolonged because it can create trouble and instability all around the Islamic world,"" he said. 
	
	
 ""We are worried that Islamic states like ourselves that support the US efforts, ultimately the population will rise against us, seeing all these innocent people being killed ... we don't want the war to be seen or to be perceived as a war against Islam."" 
	
	
 Syed Hamid said the international community must deal with terrorism rationally and form a new ""security architecture"" to combat what he described as a ""new dimension of crime against humanity"" in the long term. 
	
	
 ""For continued world economic development and growth, security architecture is important. This is not the conventional security but it is internal and we must look at terrorism and its sources,"" he said. 
	
	
 ""At the moment the focus is on Taliban and Osama bin Laden, but after that what happens? 
	
	
 ""Over the long term, we have to look at how terrorism manifests itself and have an international convention where terrorism is properly defined and where it is considered as a crime against humanity so there can be a proper tribunal."" 
	
	
 Syed Hamid said critics must also accept that the war against terrorism could affect civil liberties. 
	
	
 ""One cannot be too philosophical or idealistic about civil liberties when they can jeopardise peace and security, law and order in a country."" 
	
	
 Opposition groups in Malaysia have expressed concern that the government of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is using the US-led war on terror as a pretext to crack down on legitimate dissent. 
	
	
 Mahathir will be among APEC leaders, including US President George W. Bush, convening in Shanghai this weekend for an annual summit. 
	
	
 The summit is set to issue an anti-terrorism declaration at the conclusion of the largest gathering of world leaders since the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. 
	
	
 The declaration was necessary because terrorism was the ""most dangerous enemy of law-abiding citizens and an affront against law and democracy"", Syed Hamid said. 
	
	
 Predominantly Muslim Malaysia supports the US hunt for terrorists but opposes the attacks on Afghanistan. Mahathir has urged the United Nations to convene an international meeting on terrorism.

Moscow, 16 October: Afghan Northern Alliance units led by Gen Abdorrashid Dostum lack weapons and ammunition to properly fight the Taleban, Dostum said, noting that he ""has not received"" any Russian supplies to the Northern Alliance so far. Dostum's units are currently fighting near Mazar-e-Sharif, aiming, in particular, to seize control of populated areas in Samangan Province to block weapons supplies to Taleban units in Mazar-e-Sharif, Dostum said in an interview published in the Tuesday edition of Moskovskiye Novosti. The general said he currently commands up to 18,000 men, and about 4,000 Taleban fighters ""with military hardware"" have already gone over to his side. The US air strikes have destroyed Taleban emplacements near Mazar-e-Sharif, Dostum said. He also denied reports that the Taleban had concentrated large forces near the border with Uzbekistan. ""There are no such forces on the border with Uzbekistan. In Hayraton, near the Uzbek town of Termez, there are slightly over 100 Taleban members, according to my estimations,"" he said. Dostum said he intends to serve in the future Afghan government, representing ethnic Uzbeks. Moreover, Taleban fighters ""not stained with blood"" could be in this government, too, he said. Dostum also favoured a possible return of Afghanistan's former King Mohammad Zaher Shah.

Excerpt from report by Kazakhstan Today news agency web site 
	
	
 The Kazakh Oil national oil company's enterprises produced 4.9m t of oil in the [first] nine months of this year, that is 11.6 per cent up year on year. The extraction of oil over and above the plan - 336,000 t - was possible due to the launching of new wells and measures taken to intensify the production process, the company's press service reports. An increase in the extraction was possible thanks to the company's active investment policy which has been conducted since 2000, the press service says. Capital investments in production increased by 37 per cent in the first nine months of this year compared to the same period of 2000. Capital was invested in renewing the main facilities, increasing volumes of drilling and wells and upgrading them. The company processed 1,697,000 t of oil and fully provided the Atyrau oil refinery [in the west of the country] with oil. Kazakh Oil paid more than 34bn tenge [the current exchange rate is 148 tenge to the dollar] to the budget in the period, that is 60 per cent up year on year...

Taipei, Oct. 18 (CNA) -- The Republic of China government believes in the US commitment to separating its anti-terrorism campaign from the Taiwan Strait issue, a senior Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Thursday. 
	
	
 Stanley Kao, director of MOFA's North American Affairs Department, made the remarks amid mounting concerns about the possibility that the United States could compromise Taiwan's interests in exchange for mainland China's cooperation in the current US-led war on global terrorism. 
	
	
 Kao said US President George W. Bush's trip to Shanghai is mainly to attend the annual informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum to seek expansion of the anti-terrorism coalition. 
	
	
 Prior to his departure for Shanghai, Bush said during his meeting with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin, he will reaffirm to Jiang the US support for the ""one China"" policy as well as its desire to see a peaceful solution to all disputes between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. 
	
	
 Kao said several senior Bush administration officials, including Secretary of State Colin Powell, has also made reassurances that the United States would not seek mainland China's support for the anti-terrorism campaign at the expense of Taiwan. 
	
	
 ""We believe in the sincerity of the United States in promising not to mix up its counter-terrorism drive with the Taiwan Strait issue,"" Kao said, adding that relevant US officials have on many occasions reaffirmed similar commitments to the ROC. 
	
	
 Commenting on a Washington Post report that the Bush administration was considering waiving sanctions that bar sales of military-related equipment to mainland China, Kao said MOFA is trying to obtain more information about the report. 
	
	
 In his view, Kao said the cross-strait balance of military power is critical to the ROC's national security. Noting that the United States has consistently attached great importance to Asia-Pacific regional stability and security, Kao said the robust US arms sales package to Taiwan struck in April this year signifies that the United States is serious about security in the region. 
	
	
 Against this backdrop, Kao said, the ROC government is optimistic about defense cooperation with the United States. 
	
	
 Meanwhile, a foreign wire service report from Shanghai quoted a senior US Department of State official as saying Wednesday that the Bush administration has no plans to ease sanctions against mainland China. 
	
	
 The US official told reporters traveling with Powell en route to Shanghai for an APEC meeting that he unequivocally denied the Washington Post report that said the Bush administration was considering such a move, specifically to allow sales of spare parts for mainland Chinese-owned helicopters as another weapon in the US war on terrorism. 
	
	
 ""There's no such sale or waiver contemplated,"" he said. 
	
	
 The Post quoted US officials as saying the White House was considering a waiver of sanctions imposed after the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown in Beijing to allow the sale of parts for Black Hawks that Washington sold to mainland China in the 1980s. 
	
	
 It said the helicopters were designed for high altitudes typical of much of mainland China, including its Afghan border. Afghanistan is now under US bombardment for refusing to hand over the chief suspect in the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington, Saudi-born dissident Osama bin Laden [Usama Bin Ladin].

ZANU PF readies for war 
	
	
 By Basildon Peta Special Projects Editor 10/18/01 9:43:45 PM (GMT +2) 
	
	
 ZIMBABWE is amassing huge quantities of arms and ammunition using two African allies in preparation for next year's crucial presidential election, it has been established. Financial Gazette investigations in the past one-and-a-half months have revealed that the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Namibia are helping Zimbabwe circumvent an international arms embargo to buy huge quantities of guns and bullets for next year's ballot. 
	
	
 The arms embargo was imposed on Harare last year by Europe and the United States on President Robert Mugabe's government because of its appalling human rights record. 
	
	
 The investigations show that Zimbabwe is importing and massing an assortment of guns at army bases around the country in preparation for the poll, which is expected to be violent. 
	
	
 Most of the guns have been arriving secretly at Suri Suri airbase in Chegutu before they are distributed to other military bases and some will be sent to farms where self-styled war veterans have established bases to intimidate voters. 
	
	
 The bulk of the weapons have arrived from the DRC in that country's military cargo plane. 
	
	
 The weapons consist of a significant portion of French-made guns, most of which top government sources say will be distributed to war veterans who are central to the ruling ZANU PF party's re-election strategy in the presidential poll. 
	
	
 The sources say Zimbabwe, after the massive depletion of its armoury because of its participation in the three-year-old DRC war, has been finding it extremely difficult to replenish its arms stocks because its traditional and cheaper arms suppliers in Europe are refusing to sell it arms. 
	
	
 This had forced the army to implement some unpalatable measures, including the grounding of most of its entire fleet of Hawk fighter aircraft due to Britain's refusal to sell spare parts. 
	
	
 Virtually all European Union member states have severed ties with Zimbabwe and imposed an arms embargo on the country. 
	
	
 ""Although we can still buy a number of arms from countries like Russia and China, a greater part of our fairly priced weapons, ammunition and spares have been sourced from mainly European countries like Britain, Sweden, France and others over the years. We can no longer buy arms from Europe at the moment because of the problems here,"" said a top Ministry of Defence source. 
	
	
 ""We have been left with no alternative but to buy some weapons via our allies in the DRC who have access to some of these European weapons that we have preference for."" 
	
	
 Defence Minister Sydney Sekeramayi declined to comment on the allegations of sanctions busting and the massing of guns at army bases around the country. 
	
	
 ""Just avoid that one for now. I am not going to comment on that one,"" Sekeramayi said yesterday before immediately cutting off his telephone. 
	
	
 Asked why weapons of French origin were finding their way into Zimbabwe in an interview last month, Jerome Sautier, the first counsellor at the French embassy in Harare, and Lieutenant Colonel Dault, the defence attache, said France was not selling any arms to Zimbabwe. 
	
	
 The two said they had no knowledge of the arrival of French arms in the country but said France sold arms to several African countries which could in turn re-sell them to other countries. They said they did not know whether this was the case with Zimbabwe. 
	
	
 ""In Africa, we have military relationships with many countries. We have, for instance, sold arms to many French-speaking countries. These arms can in turn be re-sold by those other countries,"" said Sautier, adding that there was also the possibility of illegal arms trafficking outside the authority of the French government. 
	
	
 The first secretary at the Namibian High Commission in Harare, Mati Jose, said he had no knowledge of Namibia helping Zimbabwe to bust the arms embargo while the DRC's ambassador to Zimbabwe Mawapanga Mwanananga could not be reached for comment. 
	
	
 Authoritative military sources said the army will be training and arming war veterans to ensure that Mugabe is re-elected in the ballot which must be held by the end of March. 
	
	
 A number of bases have been established for the war veterans throughout Zimbabwe, particularly in those areas which did not have army camps. 
	
	
 The sources said the war veterans will operate from these bases, their main objective being to make it impossible for the MDC to campaign in rural areas. 
	
	
 Opposition supporters would also be harassed and ejected out of the rural areas to disable them from voting in their constituencies. A number of war veterans have in fact already been armed. 
	
	
 The opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) said in a statement that ZANU PF supporters who smashed MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai's vehicle and thwarted his planned meeting with his party's structures in Sanyati last week were armed with guns. 
	
	
 A senior government official said: ""I sympathize with those who want change in the presidential elections but judging by the groundwork that ZANU PF is doing to deal with the opposition, I am afraid to say that I don't see that change coming.""

Tehran, Oct 21, IRNA -- Visiting Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez here Sunday underscored the need for coordinated efforts among members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to keep oil prices at a 'fair' level. Speaking at a meeting with his Iranian counterpart President Mohammad Khatami, Chavez recalled the looming recession in world oil markets following the September 11 terrorist attacks on the U.S., and remarked that cooperation among OPEC member states, particularly the Islamic Republic is a must to secure their interests. He further called on non-OPEC oil producers to cooperate with the organization to alleviate existing concerns over falling oil prices. President Khatami, for his part, highlighted a collective quest by OPEC member states to stabilize oil prices at a reasonable level. He reiterated OPEC's concern to ensure the interests of producers and consumers, and pledged for cooperation among the members of the organization to protect producers' interests and bring price stability to world oil markets. Elsewhere in his remarks, Khatami lashed out at the recent US-led attacks on Afghanistan, and voiced Iran's displeasure with developments in the war-ravaged country. He reiterated the need to set up a coalition government in Afghanistan comprising all Afghan groups to reinforce stability. Khatami and Chavez agreed that 'Dialogue Among Civilizations' could serve to mitigate clashes of civilizations and would also ensure a durable peace. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez whose country holds the rotating chairmanship of OPEC arrived at Tehran Sunday from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for talks with President Khatami on oil related issues. He is scheduled to leave Tehran Sunday evening for Moscow to follow up his deliberations on the same subject with Russia as one of the most important non-OPEC oil producing countries. The Venezuelan president has been embarked on a tour of several European and African countries including Austria, Libya and Algeria in his efforts to garner support to prop up oil prices.

Israel's persistent and deliberate fuelling of the cycle of violence in the Palestinian territories is pushing our already turbulent region towards inevitable chaos and war. 
	
	
 This behaviour further confirms what has long been very clear; the government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is more interested in pursuing its expansionist designs on occupied Palestinian and Arab land than in engaging in serious peace-making -- a route that would require its unreserved commitment. 
	
	
 And therefore, it has blatantly obstructed all international, US, European, and regional efforts to consolidate an Israeli-Palestinian ceasefire as a prerequisite for the implementation of the Mitchell and Tenet recommendations. 
	
	
 Many observers inside and outside the region had rightly feared that Israel would callously exploit the Sept. 11 tragedy in the US to intensify and accelerate its aggression against the Palestinians and crush their efforts towards claiming their legitimate rights to freedom and independence. 
	
	
 The Sharon government is doing exactly that, in total disregard and utter defiance and disrespect of advice from Washington and London, as well as other governments, for restraint and a quick return to the negotiating table. Instead, it opts for brute force in dealing with a crisis, the exit from which, can only be achieved by the resumption of peace talks on the basis of the Mitchell report and the Tenet understandings. 
	
	
 The US expects its friends to provide it with understanding, cooperation and full support in confronting the perpetrators of the devastating attack on its centres of economic and military power. 
	
	
 But instead of reciprocating, Israel, the state that since its creation has benefited most from US protection and backing, has turned out to be a fair-weather friend. Its self-seeking manipulation of the tragedy, which, if Tel Aviv has not noticed, has affected every corner of the earth, adds yet another burden upon Washington. Sharon's likening of his invasion of Palestinian territories and the assassinations to the US-led war against the Taleban and Osama Ben Laden is abhorrent. Sharon's deceptive ploys cannot negate the fact that President Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian National Authority have and are still, even while under attack, doing their utmost to demonstrate their unambiguous commitment to stop violence, maintain the ceasefire, and get back to negotiations. 
	
	
 As the entire world is engaged in handling one of the most serious crises of our time, it is about time that Sharon and his government realise that predatory behaviour will not be tolerated for long. There is an evident international resolve to put an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict in all its aspects. The calls from Washington and London for the just and legitimate realisation of Palestinian statehood as part of such a settlement, should be viewed by the Israeli leadership as a guarantee of Israel's peace and security, but continued violence and aggression, as history has shown time and again, is a recipe for disaster.

Guangzhou, October 22 (XINHUA) -- A forum on the WTO (the World Trade Organization) and the Chinese economy was held here Monday. 
	
	
 It was held during the ongoing 90th Session of the Chinese Export Commodities Fair from October 15 to 26 in this provincial capital of south China's Guangdong Province. 
	
	
 The forum attracted wide attention both at home and abroad, as China is to be admitted into the WTO at the forthcoming new round of WTO multilateral trade talks in Doha, Qatar, in November. 
	
	
 Over 200 economists, officials and entrepreneurs attended the forum. 
	
	
 Experts said the Chinese economy will have tremendous opportunities after China's entry to the WTO, while it will also face many challenges which will require accelerated and profound reform in enterprises, the financial system and social security. 
	
	
 Wu Jinglian, a leading Chinese economist, said the WTO agenda sets a transition period of only five years for China's adaption to the WTO rules and practices. 
	
	
 He suggested that the six major risks China will confront include the development of medium-sized and small enterprises, and the setting up of a sound social security system and a society ruled by law.

MOSCOW, October 22 (Itar-Tass) - Russia is actively holding consultations with the oil exporting countries, President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in the Kremlin on Monday. This is why the current meeting with the leader of the country, which is the OPEC chairperson now, is going to be interesting, he added. 
	
	
 ""Relations with Venezuela are important for Russia, and twice as important considering the fact that at present Venezuela is the chairperson at OPEC,"" President Putin said. 
	
	
 He stressed he was especially satisfied with the fact that ""the Russian-Venezuelan dialogue has become stable and dynamic."" In his opinion, this is a positive factor, especially from the point of view of ensuring stable oil supply on the world market. He said in this connection that Russia supported the keeping of oil prices ""within the just range."" 
	
	
 In his turn, President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela expressed gratitude to Putin ""for the generosity of his soul."" 
	
	
 ""I never thought we would meet so soon,"" Chavez said. He reiterated his ""friendship and Venezuela's enormous interest in maintaining relations with Russia."" He thanked the Russian leader for meeting him immediately after his return from the Shanghai summit and the visit to Dushanbe. 
	
	
 Hugo Chavez is visiting Moscow within the framework of a long tour, which includes some European countries, Algeria, Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia. It is taking place at the time, when ever more OPEC members begin to support the idea that oil production should be reduced again, in order to stop the continuing decline of the prices of hydrocarbons on the world market. 
	
	
 Late last week the price of crude oil went down at stock exchanges to 19.07 dollars per barrel, which is the lowest level since 1999. The purpose of the trip of Hugo Chavez is to find ways of effectively protecting the oil market and the world oil prices, as well as the interests of Venezuela as one of the world's biggest oil exporters. 
	
	
 This is the second visit of Hugo Chavez to Russia this year. The first one took place last May, when he held talks with Russian leaders.

Amman -- Jordan, bound by environmental clauses in the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US, is currently mulling over signing the Kyoto Protocol on global warming even though Washington turned down the protocol six months ago. 
	
	
 Having clauses on the protection of environmental and labour rights in the body of the FTA does not stop the government from signing environmental agreements refused by the US, according to Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment Abdul Razzaq Tbeishat. 
	
	
 He explained to The Jordan Times that ""in Jordan, we conclusively believe that development cannot be achieved unless the environment is protected."" Certain steps have to be taken with regard to this objective -- including signing the Kyoto deal, he said. 
	
	
 He announced the government's intentions to sign the Kyoto treaty on Sunday during a workshop on climate change, organised by the ministry and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 
	
	
 In 1992, Jordan signed the UN Climate Change Convention that compels nations to curb global warming, which is blamed on gases produced by factories and cars that burn fuel. The Kyoto climate treaty is another international effort to limit greenhouse gases and fight global warming. 
	
	
 Asked whether signing the Kyoto Protocol will affect Jordan and US efforts to upgrade the Kingdom's environmental framework, Tbeishat said that signing the protocol will have a ""positive"" outcome on Jordan. 
	
	
 He explained that both the US and Jordan have different issues to deal with on a national level, including environmental issues. 
	
	
 ""In the US, they have their own circumstances,"" the minister said. ""But here, we are a developing country and we care about having clean industry...the whole world knows our position, [which is] to achieve sustainable development."" 
	
	
 The Kyoto Protocol was agreed upon by 160 countries under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The convention was created in 1992, and adopted in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997. 
	
	
 Under the agreement, industrialised nations must reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases by an average of 5.2 per cent (from 1990 levels) from between 2008 to 2012. 
	
	
 After the Clinton administration signed the Kyoto Protocol in November 1998, the new Bush administration overturned the decision last April, as the US was facing a faltering economy and rising energy prices.

 Six prisoners facing a capital offence have escaped. The prisoners charged with robbery with violence escaped from their cells at Molo [Rift Valley Province] Police Station. Deputy Police Spokesman Dola Indidis said the escapees gained freedom after digging out a hole on the wall using a chisel. Saying the prisoners escaped at 5.30 p.m. [local time] yesterday, Indidis said police were investigating how they obtained the chisel. He said police have been combing the area for the escapees but none of them had been re-arrested. Indidis appealed to the public to assist the police with information that might lead to the re-arrest of the prisoners.

These days, the Israeli government is adopting a relatively new tactic regarding its plan to withdraw from the Palestinian cities and towns that it had re-occupied more than three weeks ago. It is not implementing an immediate and total withdrawal -- as demanded by the international community as a whole and the United States in particular -- but a phased and partial withdrawal. It does not leave any city or town except after reaching what it calls a security agreement with the Palestinian side for a cease-fire in that particular city or town. 
	
	
 The Israeli Government hopes that this tactic would eventually lead to an integrated and total agreement when all its parts are put together to form a map of ""cantons"" that Israel envisions for the occupied Palestinian lands. Israel says that it carried out this tactic in Bethlehem and Bayt Jala, or so it claims, and yesterday, it claimed that it carried out the same tactic in Qalqiliyah when the Palestinian security forces returned to the three centers that had been re-occupied by the invading Israeli forces. The Israeli press and other media outlets point out that future withdrawals from the cities parts of which are still under Israeli occupation will be carried out in accordance to this tactic of phased and partial withdrawal. Israel seems to think that this tactic will circumvent the Palestinian move toward independence and will put an end to the Palestinian intifadah by surrounding the areas of tension and dealing with them separately. 
	
	
 The facts show that this Israeli tactic is new only in execution. Talking about it and about its possible use are several months old and, more exactly, they have been going on since the Israeli Government headed by Ari'el Sharon came to power about nine months ago. This tactic is no more than an improved carbon copy of the style of ""divide and rule."" It actually reflects Israel's determination not to deal with the Palestinian issue as one united and indivisible whole. The inevitable result of this tactic -- if it succeeds in temporarily calming down the situation -- is that it will take back conditions to their former state of tension after the withdrawals are completed from all the Palestinian cities. The core of the matter is not in the method that Israel is using to crush the Palestinian moves and confiscate the will of the Palestinian people for liberation and independence. The core of the matter lies in a just and acceptable political framework that Israel is supposed to approve and participate in to put a final end to the occupation and to the settlement construction activities. Such a political framework would lay the firm foundations for a comprehensive peace based on justice and recognition of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people. Only such a peace can bring security and stability to all the parties without exception. 
	
	
 This being the case, it would be better for both Israel and the Palestinians to have an immediate and parallel Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied parts of several Palestinian cities. Only such an immediate and parallel withdrawal would expedite the return to serious negotiations between the two sides based on the reference point of ending the occupation, ending settlement construction activities, and restoring the full inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.

Moscow, 6 November: Three spacecraft will be launched from the Baykonur space centre in November. At the present time, units of the Russian Space Forces at Baykonur have begun preparations for the sixth launch of a Proton-K booster this year. The Proton to be launched on 23 November will put a satellite into orbit for the Russian Defence Ministry's needs. Autonomous tests of a booster are under way at an assembly and testing hangar at Baykonur, and the spacecraft is simultaneously being loaded with fuel components, the press service of the Russian Space Forces reported. On 26 November, a Progress M1-7 transport spaceship should be launched from Baykonur to the International Space Station. Its launch will be carried out by a modernized Soyuz-FG booster designed and manufactured at the Progress aerospace centre in Samara. The engines of the rocket's second and third stages have been modernized, and this will be the second launch of the modernized booster carried out by the Russian Aerospace Agency, Rosaviakosmos. The first one took place on 21 May of this year. The launch of a Zenit-2 booster produced by the Dnipropetrovsk Yuzhmash enterprise is preliminarily scheduled for 30 November. The rocket will put a Meteor-3M hydrometeorological spacecraft into orbit.

BANGUI, Nov 6 (AFP) - Gunfire broke out for a fifth day Tuesday in the capital of the Central African Republic, after Libyan military reinforcements were flown in to help government forces end a standoff by soldiers loyal to an ousted army chief. Shooting was heard in northern Bangui and near the airport in a neighborhood inhabited by officials in President Ange Felix Patasse's government, an AFP correspondent said. 
	
	
 The rest of the city was reported to be calm however, with some schools reopening and authorities anxiously awaiting the arrival of a mediation team from the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). The crisis in the Central African Republic began late Friday after soldiers loyal to sacked chief of army staff Francois Bozize exchanged gunfire with presidential guard units and government troops. 
	
	
 The shooting began after soldiers tried to arrest Bozize, a former close ally of Patasse who had been army chief since 1996, in connection with large amounts of weapons discovered in the city, amid suspicions of an attack in preparation. 
	
	
 The country has been on edge since last May when mutinous soldiers attempted to overthrow Patasse, unleashing 10 days of fighting in the capital that left dozens of people dead and displaced thousands. Bozize was fired last month as part of moves by Bangui to close security loopholes which became evident after the abortive putsch. 
	
	
 Defense and security ministers were dismissed in August. Libyan forces helped prop up Patasse at the time, and 100 soldiers have since remained in his presidential guard. On Monday, 80 Libyan soldiers disembarked from an Antonov transport plane carrying military equipment, an African diplomat said. On Tuesday, Bozize was still holed up in his Bangui residence.

After their withdrawal from Bethlehem, Bayt Jala, and Qalqilya, the Israeli forces withdrew from Ramallah yesterday, but they maintained the siege and closure around the city. This means that the suffering of the citizens in Ramallah, like the suffering of the citizens in Bethlehem, Bayt Jala, and Qalqilya, will continue on the roadblocks, affecting their medical, economic, educational, and social life. No other people in the world have seen such suffering. The main and perhaps only reason for this suffering is the continuing Israeli occupation and its heavy burden on Palestinian citizens. 
	
	
 The Israeli withdrawal was a correction of a mistake the Israeli Government made when it decided to reoccupy parts of the main West Bank cities following the assassination of Israeli minister Rehav'am Ze'evi. The reoccupation was a kind of collective punishment for the inhabitants of those cities and the villages around them, villages that constitute an organic and vital extension of the cities. The Israeli forces destroyed buildings and installations in those cities, arrested dozens of citizens, and killed dozens others. That showed that the ruling right-wing coalition in Israel is pursuing an occupational policy and is not, in the first place, willing to recognize the firm national Palestinian rights to freedom, independence, and the end of occupation and settlement. 
	
	
 This policy, which disregards the need to establish a just peace based on the need for the Palestinian people to regain their freedom and independence, is reflected in statements made by the Israeli officials, who brag about the large number of Palestinians who were killed or arrested by the Israeli forces. It is also reflected in the fact that the ruling Israeli coalition has no agreed-upon political plan and that the settlement plans and initiatives that are attributed to this Israeli official or that are unable to meet the minimum legitimate Palestinian demands. These initiatives and plans largely try to keep as much hegemony and as many settlements as possible on Palestinian lands, resources, airspace, and crossing points. 
	
	
 In its approach to the national Palestinian rights the Israeli Government is playing the cat and mouse game. It is trying to use the time factor to perpetuate the occupation. It is also working to push the Palestinians and the world into new labyrinths and tunnels, inside the old tunnels, to distract them from the main and central demands. The cycle of reoccupation-withdrawal-reoccupation is part of this approach, which is no secret to anyone. 
	
	
 The only way to peace lies in the full Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian territories that were occupied in 1967 and the termination of the occupational and settlement presence in these territories. The way to peace does not lie in devious methods to circumvent the inalienable Palestinian rights. Such methods would only complicate things and add fuel to the raging fire.

BEIJING, Nov 8 (AFP) - United Nations Human Rights Commissioner Mary Robinson began a visit to China on Thursday with a warning to her hosts not to use the war against terror as an excuse for repression. 
	
	
 Robinson told reporters in Beijing she would raise individual cases of prisoners as well as her concerns about the ""widespread"" use of torture in China and the treatment of people in the regions of Tibet and Xinjiang. 
	
	
 Robinson, who is due to attend discussions on human rights education and meet President Jiang Zemin during her two-day trip, began the visit by signing an agreement between the UN and China on further cooperation in human rights dialogue during 2002. 
	
	
 Afterwards, answering questions alongside co-signatory Vice Foreign Minister Wang Guangya, she made it clear measures to crack down on terrorism should not be used to justify rights abuses. 
	
	
 The former Irish president said she was concerned at ""a worrying trend in a number of countries to use the excuse of combating terrorism to clamp down on freedom of expression and legitimate dissent which is not violent"". 
	
	
 She specifically highlighted the situation of the ethnic Uighhur Muslim population of Xinjiang, China's furthest west region, where rights groups have claimed a crackdown against separatists has been stepped up since the September 11 attacks on the United States. 
	
	
 In anti-terror campaigns, ""there must also be very clear boundaries and I am worried specifically about the Uighur population in Xinjiang, I am worried about the situation in areas like Tibet for example, which I wish to raise,"" she said. 
	
	
 Any cooperation with China over rights issues would not blunt further criticism, she pledged. 
	
	
 ""I adopt a two pronged approach. One is to encourage this cooperation and the other is to express concerns about serious situations of human rights violations or shortcomings, that I will also do."" 
	
	
 China later denied there were abuses in Xinjiang and Tibet and said the real issue was separatists -- Uighurs who want an independent state of East Turkestan and Tibetans associated with the Dalai Lama -- taking advantage of the international crisis. 
	
	
 In Xinjiang and Tibet, ""the situation there is very good"" said foreign ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao. 
	
	
 ""If there are problems out there it is the issue of separatists who want to undermine the situation, and a very important issue is the East Turkestan terrorists and the Dalai Lama separatist clique,"" he told a press briefing. 
	
	
 That the fight against Xinjiang ""terrorists"" was part of the global anti-terror battle ""should be very clear, no double standards should be pursued here,"" he added. 
	
	
 China has repeatedly said it is ""a victim of terrorism"" in Xinjiang, which borders Afghanistan, and there have been reports of Uighur activists being rounded up following the September 11 attacks. 
	
	
 Robinson said that among other issues she would bring up was the ""widespread"" problem of torture in China. 
	
	
 ""I will also raise some individual cases and express concerns. I do this in each country that I visit,"" she said. 
	
	
 However despite previous discussions ""I haven't had as much progress on individual cases as I have wished to,"" she added. 
	
	
 Analysts have warned that however tough Robinson's talk, international attention is probably too firmly focused on the anti-terror coalition, of which China is a part, to place much pressure on Beijing over human rights.

United Nations, New York, Nov 11, IRNA -- President Mohammad Khatami and his Venezuelan counterpart Hugo Chavez here Saturday cited cooperation among OPEC member countries as the key to forestalling further oil price declines. The Iranian president also hailed Chavez's recent efforts in travelling to OPEC and non-OPEC member countries, in a bid to garner support for propping up the sagging crude prices. Khatami, who had met with Chavez on the sidelines of a UN General Assembly session, also explained the ongoing Afghan crisis in the wake of the US-led strikes as well as the Islamic Republic's stance on the September 11 terror attacks in Washington and New York. He reiterated his call for a global peace coalition, based on justice, to stem the roots of terrorism. ""Forming a world-wide coalition based on peace and justice to eradicate the ominous phenomenon of terrorism is a must,"" Khatami said. Chavez, whose country currently heads the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), said that Venezuela's recent efforts in the form of his whirlwind trips to OPEC and non-OPEC member countries, were in line with the interests of all the oil producing countries. He also described cooperation among OPEC and non-OPEC countries as a boost to their national interests. Chavez voiced ""the Latin American concern"" on the ongoing crisis in the Middle East, saying Caracas was following the international stance on the fight against terrorism, violence and intrigues. OPEC is due to hold a meeting in Vienna on Wednesday to discuss the widely expected production cut. He also called for further expansion of bilateral cooperation between Tehran and Caracas in various international fields, such as OPEC and the Group of 77 (G77) of the world developing countries. Khatami is currently in New York to attend a special session of the UN General Assembly on 'Dialogue Among Civilizations' to have an international convention on the theme approved. The United Nations designated 2001, as the Year of 'Dialogue among Civilizations' on President Khatami's initiative.

WE are not going to remain silent. You can count on that. You know us, said Remi Parmentier, the political director of Greenpeace International. He was responding to a question from Gulf Times whether there would be demonstrations during the WTO ministerial meeting, which opened in Doha yesterday. 
	
	
 Parmentier, however, did not say categorically that there would be street demonstrations. But, he added that the Qatari government had neither sought nor was given any commitment by Greenpeace not to undertake demonstrations. 
	
	
 We discussed a number of conditions for the boat to be allowed to moor here and we have fulfilled all those conditions, the environmentalist told reporters on board the ship at the Doha harbour, before setting sail towards Doha Sheraton, the conference venue. So, we will act very responsibly and I have given all guarantees to Sheikh (Hamad bin Faisal) al-Thani (chairman of the organising committee) that we would be responsible, peaceful and that we would act in a very constructive manner with them. 
	
	
 But, he added that the Greenpeace is here to voice the concerns of millions of people. We are going to give a voice to people that you dont want to hear. And thats the meaning of the Rainbow Warrior being here. And the people who are here are going to voice their concerns and voice their demands. 
	
	
 Parmentier said they would use every possible peaceful means at our disposal to make sure that the voice of the people is heard. He pointed out that Qatar, while presenting Dohas candidature to host the meeting, had made an official commitment that it would allow peaceful protests. 
	
	
 Earlier, the Rainbow Warrior sailed into Doha on Thursday morning, to challenge the WTO to use the 4th ministerial conference to force the United States to commit to the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. 
	
	
 Talking to the press, Greenpeace executive director Gerd Leipold said currently the most important issue is climate change. If we continue to burn fossil fuel at the rate we are going today, we look at a bleak future. Islands will go under, nations will vanish from the face of earth and millions of people will have to leave their homes. 
	
	
 The environmental organisation warned the delegates at the conference that the principles of the WTO would be rendered worthless unless the meeting extracted the commitment from the US on Kyoto Protocol. 
	
	
 The US produces 25% of world green house gases but has only 4% of the population of the world. It just cannot be that one country reaps all the benefits of mock globalisation but does not take any responsibility for the biggest global problem we are facing today. This is fundamentally unfair and unjust, Leipold said. 
	
	
 Parmentier said, on the one hand, the WTO claims to support sustainable development and environmental protection and on the other, it does virtually nothing to protect the environment. 
	
	
 The Kyoto Protocol rejection by the US is in effect a hidden subsidy. This is a breach of the very constitution of WTO. The WTO claims that it wants to protect the environment. Then today, in Doha, they must condemn the US for allowing a hidden subsidy, which according to the US governments own figures is equivalent to between $76.7bn and $300bn by 2010. This is the first test case for WTO. 
	
	
 Parmentier urged the delegates not to even discuss the possibility of a new round of trade negotiations unless the US this week in Doha ratifies the Kyoto Protocol. 
	
	
 He said Greenpeace looked forward to work in partnership with developing countries to get the proper assessment of the impact of the WTO instead of a new round of trade negotiations. In 1993, when the WTO was created everybody jumped without checking whether there was a proper safety net at the bottom. What we are saying is, lets not jump again too quickly and lets check if there is a safety net. And lets consolidate those safety nets before we jump into a new round. This is the only responsible course of action and it will be a historic success for Doha and we want this meeting to be a success. 
	
	
 If in six days time there has been no new round, this meeting will have been a success, because it will force the WTO to change, he said. WTO decisions must not be allowed to overrule international environmental agreements; the precautionary principle must be incorporated in decision-making, and patents on life must be banned, Parmentier added. 
	
	
 On board the Rainbow Warrior are nationalities from 18 countries, including witnesses from local communities who will testify to the adverse effects of WTO global policies. The organisation will also be broadcasting No New Round Radio daily over the Internet. 
	
	
 Parmentier hoped the Qatari authorities would honour their commitment to allow free access to the people of the country to the ship and vice versa. 
	
	
 Answering another question, he said the WTO came to Qatar to hide from protestors. They can run but they cannot hide, he said.

JAMMU, India, Nov 11 (AFP) - Indian security forces Sunday killed 11 Muslim militants in Indian-administered Kashmir, police said. 
	
	
 The separatists were killed in two separate encounters in the Mandi area of the southern Poonch district, 225 kilometres (140 miles) northwest of Kashmir's winter capital Jammu.

 Police and militants exchanged heavy gunfire, killing six rebels in Bandi and five in Jalian, Jammu police senior superintendent Kamal Saini said.

Energy Secretary Ernesto Martens has admitted that it is unfeasible to guarantee the flow of revenues to the government if the Finance Secretariat maintains its estimate that the crude export platform in 2002 will average 1.825 million barrels per day, at a price of $17.00 per barrel. 
	
	
 ""One would have to talk in depth with the Finance Secretariat's people to hear the criteria that they used to establish that benchmark,"" he claimed, declining to give details on the manner in which the federal government's secretariats establish the price of crude in the General Criteria for Economic Policy. 
	
	
 In fact, Martens admitted that this volume of crude exports has not been achieved this year. According to Pemex [Mexican Petroleum] figures, between January and September the daily exports of barrels of oil did not exceed an average of 1.71 million. During September alone, this average dropped to 1.64 million. 
	
	
 In the General Preliminary Criteria for Economic Policy 2002, the final text of which is being presented to Congress by the government today, the Finance Secretariat estimated an average price of $17.00 per barrel for the crude mixture, and predicted that the export platform would be 1.825 million barrels per day. 
	
	
 The volume appears large in the current economic context, when oil prices have fallen back to 1999 levels. Hence, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), will decide at its meeting on Wednesday whether or not to cut its worldwide crude production in an effort to shore up energy prices. 
	
	
 Traditionally, Mexico has supported the OPEC cutbacks; however, analysts agreed that it will now tend to support the United States, the main world consumer, and the one that would be adversely affected by a possible increase in crude prices. 
	
	
 George Baker, director of Mexico Energy Intelligence, expressed this opinion: ""In the event that the Mexican Government gives priority to its relationship with the United States, it will not be a game without risks. And it is possible that, at some given time, OPEC may hand it the bill for not collaborating in the reduction of the oil supply."" 
	
	
 He noted that the Mexican economy is very closely linked to that of the United States, and hence no oil producer, whether a member of OPEC or not, is in such a disadvantageous situation. 
	
	
 Frederic Lasserre, an energy sector analyst for the firm Societe Generale, held the view that Mexico's close relationship with the United States prevents it from becoming more committed to OPEC. 
	
	
 ""The US authorities would not like to have it (Mexico) as a trading partner and, at the same time, close to OPEC,"" he observed. 
	
	
 With regard to prices, he gave a reminder that the reason that prompted Mexico to collaborate with OPEC in 1998 was, in fact, the decline in them. 
	
	
 But Ken Miller, from the firm Purvin &amp;amp; Gertz, included an additional factor. 
	
	
 ""Mexico sought out the leading producers: Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, not only for the prices, but also because of the competition on the crude oil market (in US territory),"" he claimed, pointing out that prices have not yet fallen as low as they did then. 
	
	
 In 1998, the Mexican oil mixture averaged $10.17 per barrel: now, the lowest levels have reached $14.00 per barrel. 
	
	
 Miller remarked that the worldwide economic slowdown has shrunk the demand for energy sources, which could lead the independent producers, including Mexico, to operate in coordination with the oil cartel. 
	
	
 Nevertheless, according to the researcher from the UNAM [National Autonomous University of Mexico] Economics Department, Angel de la Vega, since the Fox administration does not have the security of a fiscal reform available, it cannot be ruled out that Mexico might collaborate with OPEC in the event of a more serious reduction in oil prices. 
	
	
 Miguel Garcia Reyes, a specialist in petroleum geopolitics at the College of Mexico, claimed that Mexico's distancing from OPEC has become more intensified since the attacks on the United States. 
	
	
 He emphasized: ""Now Mexico is positioned between two fronts: it recognizes the need for reducing the supply on the market, but the policy is to support the United States and supply it with more crude if it should become necessary."" 
	
	
 In terms of market, the Mexican exports do not play an important role, but the support for OPEC on the part of Mexico, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia in 1998 and 1999 lent credibility to the policy of cutbacks, and achieved the recovery of prices. 
	
	
 Promises Are Cheap 
	
	
 The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has agreed on three cuts in its production thus far this year, for the purpose of preventing the crude prices from becoming weaker. Nevertheless, it has not kept its promises.

THE ABDUCTION of a French diplomat's wife on Thursday has introduced a political dimension to the kidnap-for-ransom pestilence that has spread dramatically during the past 10 months. 
	
	
 The kidnap gang freed her and her driver within two hours of seizure. No ransom was paid. 
	
	
 The abduction, however, delivered a more devastating blow on the capacity of the Macapagal administration to crack down on kidnap syndicates than the grim statistics trotted out by Teresita Ang-See, the Chinese-Filipino anti-crime ""crusader,"" who has relished the role of Cassandra to the Philippine National Police under the new administration. 
	
	
 Since 1992 when organized crime became a leading preoccupation in the national agenda, the main victims of the predatory syndicates have been Ang-See's compatriots in the Chinese-Filipino community. 
	
	
 The conventional explanation is that because of their wealth, they are the logical prey from which to extract ransom money--a perverse form of nationalist racism and redistribution of national wealth. 
	
	
 The Abu Sayyaf kidnapping of foreigners in Sipadan, Malaysia, and in Dos Palmas, Palawan, broke this ethnicity pattern. 
	
	
 But the seizure of the diplomat's wife and her driver was the first time in 10 years that the gangs struck at members of the diplomatic community, whose immunity has been somehow respected by organized syndicates. 
	
	
 The seizure sent alarm bells ringing in the diplomatic community in this country. The repercussions in the home governments and countries are as damaging as the prolonged hostage-taking by the Abu Sayyaf of French, German, Malaysian, Lebanese and Finnish nationals during the Estrada administration. 
	
	
 Then President Joseph Estrada had to cancel visits to Paris and other European capitals in 2000 after he was told that he would receive a hostile reception from the European public over the lengthy impasse of negotiations for the hostages' release. 
	
	
 From my own sources in the diplomatic community, as well as in the Philippine National Police, the diplomat's wife and her driver went to the French school in Bicutan at around 10 a.m., in response to a call from school authorities who reported that her son had some accident. 
	
	
 On the way, a group of about six armed men in uniforms blocked her brand-new car (which had no diplomatic plate) at Better Living Subdivision, Paranaque, and boarded it. 
	
	
 The gang drove the car around the vicinity while they interrogated the victims for about two hours. The hijackers asked them for money--one million pesos was mentioned--which she had supposedly withdrawn from the bank. She told them she had not withdrawn such money and that she was the wife of a senior French diplomat. The gunmen let her go. 
	
	
 The PNP, which believes it was a case of mistaken identity, could not explain why it took the gang two hours to know the identity of the lady. 
	
	
 After detaining them for about two hours, they drove her and the driver to a squatters' area and dropped them off near the Bicutan exit, but not before they took her necklace and wallet. 
	
	
 They did not take her ring and other pieces of jewelry. The gang fled with the car, and the victims took a tricycle home. The details of the crime and the swift release are less important than the political implications. Whether the incident was plain holdup, as the PNP would like to see it, the abduction reinforced the growing perception in the diplomatic community and foreign governments that there is a breakdown in law and order and that the Macapagal administration is not in control. 
	
	
 This perception is also fueled by the crime statistics of Ang-See, who represents the pessimistic outlook in contrast to the more dismissive outlook of the PNP whose statistics are less alarming than those of Ang-See. 
	
	
 While Ang-See's statistics, derived mainly from non-official sources, paint a grim picture, they should not be ignored. 
	
	
 At the same time, the PNP can't be burying its head in the sand and offering explanations all the time, rather than check the rise of kidnappings. 
	
	
 Ang-See's close collaboration with former PNP chief, now Sen. Panfilo Lacson, is an open secret. Some administration officials wonder whether she paints doomsday scenarios just to embarrass the administration and to portray the contrast in performance between the PNP under Lacson and the current PNP leadership, which has no love lost with Lacson. 
	
	
 Since the members of the diplomatic community had previously been immune from the predatory attacks of the gang, the abduction of the diplomat's wife naturally has generated anxieties among foreign governments about how safe their diplomats are in this country. 
	
	
 There is a strong perception in the diplomatic community that the abduction was a fake kidnap-for- ransom and was a political act to demonstrate the administration's incapacity to put crime under control. 
	
	
 The reasoning behind this perception is that if the gangs were after ransom money, it did not matter whether their victims belonged to the diplomatic community. 
	
	
 The perception is that there was a political message in the abductions staged by some groups that are determined to make this government fail. 
	
	
 A number of embassies here, including the American, French, German and Japanese, have issued advisories to their nationals warning them of risks when travelling in some parts of the country. 
	
	
 The advisories have been prompted by domestic lawlessness and political turbulence rather than by a possible outbreak of insidious terrorist attacks associated with al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden and provoked by the American military action in Afghanistan. 
	
	
 At the rate syndicates are abducting targets--regardless of their ethnic identity and their diplomatic status--with impunity, the administration faces a more serious and direct challenge to its capacity to govern from the specter of lawlessness than from the daunting problem of sparking an economic recovery amid the global economic downturn. 
	
	
 We don't need al-Qaida terrorist attacks in this country to bring the government down in turmoil, create uncertainties in the business community, and frighten tourists and investors away. 
	
	
 The diplomatic community's perception of President Macapagal is that she is organized, knows her economics, does her homework, and has been unscathed by scandals that have been rubbed on her skin by a scandal-mongering opposition. 
	
	
 But the downside is that the deterioration of peace and order is her nemesis that is undoing all her diplomatic initiatives in the world stage to project the Philippines as a staunch ally in the US-led coalition in the war on international terrorism. 
	
	
 Some diplomats raise questions about her priorities. They think she is travelling too much, while internal problems sap the country's energy, and that she has misplaced strategic priorities in her overseas visits. 
	
	
 The fire is raging at home, these sources say, not in the United States, China, Japan or Afghanistan. Her hoses have to be directed at internal terrorism. She has more dangerous enemies at home than elsewhere.

Beijing, November 12 (XINHUA) -- Many Chinese farmers have begun growing crops in computer-controlled rooms instead of tilling fields with spades. 
	
	
 They apply fertilizer, water fields and treat insect pest with equipment controlled by computers in intelligent farm workshops. Their products, in high quality and great variety, are shipped to supermarkets and hotels and sold at a good price. 
	
	
 More than 150 agro-technological guiding systems have been set up in Yunnan, Anhui, Jilin and Hainan provinces to teach farmers how to cultivate grain crops, vegetables, fruit and aquatic products. 
	
	
 In the 20 demonstration zones built between 1998 and 2000, grain output was increased by 2 billion kg, saving 640 million yuan in production costs. 
	
	
 Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the cities of Shanghai and Beijing are experimenting with the satellite positioning technology for accurate control of fertilizer application.

President Fernando de la Rua, Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo The summit between George W. Bush and Fernando de la Rua may have changed many things, but it may also have changed nothing. In the latter case, the blame for this fruitless effort belongs not to the stinginess of the US Government but rather to a mix of shortsightedness and irresponsibility among Argentine leaders. 
	
	
 Argentina had to show the world that the decision to reschedule its public debt is not a default in disguise; moreover, the success of the most recent economic plan is at stake. In spite of all this, our politicians did not meet either of the requirements that were described in detail from abroad: there had to be an agreement between the national government and the provinces in connection with revenue sharing, and Peronism also had to send a clear-cut message that it would help get the 2002 budget passed in Congress. 
	
	
 An accord with the governors would be a clear sign that public spending was going to be brought under control where it is most out of control. And the budget would have been a message from the political community at large, not just from the president and his top ministers, that the zero deficit program enjoys a consensus. 
	
	
 As if not enough messages in this regard had been conveyed through a thousand different channels, the powerful head of the National Security Council, Condoleeza Rice, who is Bush's chief adviser, put it bluntly in public remarks last Thursday that came close to representing interference in the country's domestic affairs. 
	
	
 Rice even went so far as to mention the need for political leadership in Argentina to resolve its economic crisis. Argentine leaders, regardless of their leanings, were thus supposed to demonstrate their commitment to economic austerity and their determination to confirm and honor the institutional timetable of the De la Rua administration. The president, in turn, was supposed to give evidence of his ability to manage the conflict. 
	
	
 De la Rua waited anxiously until Saturday evening for his cabinet chief, Chrystian Colombo, to at least announce that an accord with the Peronist governors would be signed on Monday (this would also have been a sign about the budget, because of the influence that the governors have over their provincial lawmakers). Colombo called him up, but only to tell him that it had all been in vain. 
	
	
 In this sort of crisis there can never be just one guilty party. The government is also paying the price for its delays in putting together a plan in the wake of its electoral defeat, with interest payments on the public debt maturing very soon as well. It was also quite naive to think that Peronism would readily reach an agreement with a defeated administration. The new federal pact will necessarily mean that those who won the elections will have to give up funding. 
	
	
 Domingo Cavallo was not at the meeting with Bush because his president, seeing that his hands would be empty, wanted to ignore economic issues at the summit. He realized that nothing would come of a meeting whose demands had been clearly stated and then not met. Why put emphasis on economic issues, on the only area in which failure would be a foregone conclusion? 
	
	
 Argentina, which in recent days has again been making all of the world's newspapers in the worst sort of way, had to fulfill these requirements because it needed to gain Washington's active, not just verbal, support. 
	
	
 First off, Bush could have brought discipline to his administration in connection with the case of Argentina. Among US Government institutions, the State Department is the one most inclined to help Argentina, followed by the Security Council, albeit less enthusiastically. The Treasury Department, however, in spite of the good offices of its number two man, John Taylor, is still taking the cool approach towards Argentina that its head, Paul O'Neill, had adopted. 
	
	
 The Argentine Government wants fresh funds in order to reschedule its debt, funds that could come from the International Monetary Fund or the US Treasury itself. A less utopian wish is to get multilateral agencies, or some of them, to guarantee the Argentine offers to its creditors. 
	
	
 The De la Rua administration has an even more urgent need: regardless of what might be said, Argentina needs the IMF to disburse as soon as possible more than $1.2 billion that is scheduled for December. 
	
	
 Internal Discipline 
	
	
 In either of these cases, Washington had to be convinced that Argentina deserved bailing out and then act accordingly. How could the United States be asked to do such a thing if Argentina was unable to show a modicum of internal political discipline in advance? 
	
	
 The political accords reached in New York were noteworthy, because the Argentine Government supported all of the US Government's present and future needs in the war in Afghanistan. But those were the US needs. 
	
	
 The Argentine Foreign Ministry had previously stopped importuning Brasilia to have Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Argentine President De la Rua meet jointly with Bush, as they had agreed to do at the most recent meeting between the two countries in Sao Paulo. That sort of meeting would have lent a noteworthy twist to the Argentine case.

With the impression that the excursion of the government's top brass to New York did not change the picture much, and that the game is continuing in Buenos Aires for now, Argentina's creditors are preparing for the debt negotiation with various concerns in mind. 
	
	
 The first one, which was revealed piecemeal during the tour headed by Fernando de la Rua, is that Domingo Cavallo has become irritating. The bankers made it clear that they prefer Daniel Marx, and not the minister's confrontational style. 
	
	
 As El Cronista was told by a source from an investment bank who followed the visit closely, that issue has various aspects: the economy minister's gradual loss of credibility, the confusion about the role of Jacob Frenkel and Merrill Lynch, and the economic team's apparent lack of a strategy, as well as the Alliance government's obvious domestic difficulties. 
	
	
 The creditors have in mind a negotiation in which they would be represented by a more heterogeneous steering committee than during the 1980's: not only large banks, but also portfolio administrators, pension funds, insurers, and other investors. 
	
	
 In fact, the Emerging Markets Creditors Association (EMCA), which meets today, Tuesday, in New York, to deal with the Argentine case, wrote a letter to Cavallo saying that ""a consultation process is an important part of the solution,"" and cautioning that ""the way in which Argentina negotiates with its creditors now will have direct effects on its chances of gaining access to the markets in the future."" 
	
	
 ""Cavallo cannot say 'take it or leave it,' as in the local swap,"" noted the source, as an example. Marx understands ""the importance of the menu"" for gaining the creditors' good will. Among the latter there is consensus that there will be a remission of capital and/or interest, but there must be options that are geared to the situation of each one. 
	
	
 Another concern about the negotiation has been generated by the leading role given to Jacob Frenkel, Merrill Lynch's international vice president. The source added: ""As an adviser, he could be very useful, but the relationship with Merrill Lynch bothers many other creditors."" 
	
	
 The creditors interpret strategy to mean a clear definition of what is and what is not negotiable. According to the source, ""A key man is the finance secretary: he must specify the government's fiscal margin."" He spoke even more clearly about the finance secretary: ""Marx is sufficiently patriotic, he has a pleasant personality, and he knows enough about the market to be a good negotiator. If he left now, it would be a disaster for the government,"" was his response. 
	
	
 On the other hand, for now, the creditors do not see any signals of concrete support from the G-7. A paper published yesterday by the CS First Boston bank noted: ""The most recent statements from Washington suggest that it (the G-7 support) is unlikely, but we are not precluding the possibility of surprises."" 
	
	
 Faced With the Crisis, Giavarini Accentuates His Influence 
	
	
 Foreign Minister Adalberto Rodriguez Giavarini continued to cultivate his new role as conciliator in the United States yesterday, at a meeting with his counterparts from the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] countries. 
	
	
 The minister's current priority involves binding wounds opened by his colleague in the Economy Ministry, Domingo Cavallo, which have put the regional union in general, and the relations with Brazil in particular, in a risk zone. 
	
	
 Rodriguez Giavarini has not failed to attend to other matters of his ministry, such as meeting with his Chinese colleague, and preparing to visit Germany, where he will meet tomorrow with President Fernando de la Rua, who will travel there from Buenos Aires. 
	
	
 But it is evident that, during the past few weeks, the official has taken responsibility for a fundamental task: to tone down Cavallo's tendency toward confrontation. That conduct has heightened the suspicion aimed at Argentina, a disadvantageous situation, with De la Rua even risking his own future in an interview with the US president, George W. Bush, in which Cavallo ultimately did not participate, at the president's order. 
	
	
 Finance Secretary Daniel Marx has again handled some of the negotiations for the restructuring of the debt, after a management by Rodriguez Giavarini. The foreign minister convinced the president of the political disadvantage that would be entailed by leaving that official aside, on the verge of complex dialogues with the US Treasury, and with multilateral and financing agencies. 
	
	
 There were meetings at Olivos over the weekend of 3-4 November, which resulted in the official decision to appoint Marx as the main negotiator of the fine print in the agreements. The latter will be reached in the event that the international holders of Argentine bonds agree to swap the instruments, which yield high interest, for others with rates not exceeding 7 percent. 
	
	
 Cavallo had delegated his debt swap strategy to external advisers, such as the attorney, Horacio Liendo, and the Israeli economist, Jacob Frenkel. 
	
	
 The foreign minister warned De la Rua personally about the leap into the void that would be represented by leaving Marx out of the negotiations, when he is one of the few to have a smooth-flowing dialogue with the IMF staff officials. 
	
	
 Rodriguez Giavarini's management took place when there was a deluge of doubts about the sustainability of the plan announced by Cavallo. 
	
	
 There were hours during which he had feverish contacts with international diplomats and leaders. 
	
	
 Resulting from these dialogues were communiques from the G-7 and the Treasury, with contents to be discussed. But those agencies are not putting their letterhead on anything.

United Nations, November 14 (XINHUA) -- It was unrealistic to envisage that people who were suffering from lack of development, poverty, hunger and poor health could fully enjoy their human rights, several delegations stressed Wednesday to the Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian, Cultural) of the 56th UN General Assembly. 
	
	
 The committee Wednesday opened a formal debate on human rights questions, including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
	
	
 Representatives said that the right to development was one of two major preconditions to ensure the universal protection and promotion of human rights, a press release of the committee said. 
	
	
 ""The second crucial element, maintaining international peace and security, was also emphasized as the Committee continued its debate on human rights questions, including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms,"" it said. 
	
	
 Briefing on the remarks by the representative of Thailand, it said: ""Human rights and development were two sides of the same coin, and should be addressed in tandem."" 
	
	
 ""People should be at the center of social and economic development efforts. They had to be protected from other scourges and social ills, including disease, narcotic drugs, armed conflicts, terrorism and other types of transnational organized crime,"" it added. 
	
	
 The representative of Eritrea said globalization was not only threatening to further marginalize the developing world and alienate its masses, it was also hampering the ability to exercise the rights and duties enshrined in numerous international human rights instruments, including the right to development. 
	
	
 ""Narrowing the development gap between countries was crucial to the realization of universal human rights,"" said the representative of China Shen Guofang. ""Underdevelopment had seriously hindered the capacity of developing countries to protect and promote human rights."" 
	
	
 ""With the rapid spread of globalization and economic expansion, the situation for poor countries was deteriorating with each passing day,"" Shen said. 
	
	
 The representative of the United States said that despite the horrors of the terrorist attack, the international community could not truly win the war against terrorism unless human rights were protected. 
	
	
 ""There could be no expediency, no compromise, no lapse in vigilance,"" he said. ""Promoting and strengthening human rights and democracy throughout the world was an integral part of the multilateral war on terrorism"". 
	
	
 Also speaking on the debate were the representatives of Cuba, Egypt, Morocco, Japan, Venezuela, Mali, Greece and Indonesia. 
	
	
 The committee will meet again Thursday to continue its general debate on human rights questions.

 Tashkent, 14 November: Japanese investment in Uzbekistan in the last 10 years reached 1.3bn US dollars, Uzbek President Islam Karimov said in a meeting with Japanese lawmakers in Tashkent on Wednesday [14 November]. He said this investment was made in various industries, including health care, education, and in improvement of water supplies in the country. Karimov stressed that trade turnover between Uzbekistan and Japan in 2001 is expected to be quite good. In the first 10 months of this year, it was 133m US dollars, which is almost double of the amount of last year when it was 71m US dollars.

With international consensus having been reached regarding a treaty to combat climate change, a ``red light'' has been issued to South Korea's heavily carbon-dependent industries. 
	
	
 Last Saturday, representatives of 165 countries finally agreed on the rules to implement the 1997 Kyoto Protocol after two weeks of negotiations held in Marrakech, Morocco. 
	
	
 According to the accord, about 40 industrialized countries must cut or limit emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases by an average of 5.2 percent from 1990 levels by 2012. 
	
	
 Scientists believe these ``greenhouse'' gases (GHG), which mainly result from burning fossil fuels, raise the earth's temperature and change the climate by creating floods, droughts, and other abnormal weather phenomena. 
	
	
 As South Korea is not included in the Annex I parties, composed of industrialized countries, the accord, which is expected to go into effect some time next year, is not likely to affect the country for a while. 
	
	
 Although a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), South Korea is still regarded as a developing country and is not obliged to reduce its GHG emissions under the treaty. 
	
	
 But considering that South Korea has the highest growth rate of carbon dioxide emissions in the world, it will not be able to fend off international pressure to join in the global campaign to reduce greenhouse gases much longer, experts note. 
	
	
 According to statistics released by International Energy Agency (IEA), a Paris-based agency affiliated with the OECD, South Korea was found to have recorded the highest growth rate of carbon dioxide emissions in 1999, showing a 75.5 percent increase since 1990. 
	
	
 In terms of the amount of emissions, South Korea discharged 410 million tons of carbon dioxide in 1999, ranking tenth in the world. 
	
	
 If industrialized countries start cutting back on GHG emissions from 2008, when the first target period begins, South Korea will become the seventh most carbon dioxide-producing country in the world, according to IEA figures. 
	
	
 But the government has not taken any concrete steps regarding the cutback of greenhouse gas emissions, maintaining a wait-and-see approach instead. 
	
	
 ``As South Korea has `developing country' status, we are not in a position to voluntarily express our course of action,'' said Yoon Jong-soo, director of the global environment office at the Environment Ministry. 
	
	
 ``We estimate Korea will probably join the countries cutting back emissions no later than 2018. Until then, we plan to step up efforts to gradually change our energy structure and reduce greenhouse gases by promoting research on renewable energy and energy-efficient technologies,'' he said. 
	
	
 Jun Mu, deputy director of the industry and environment team at the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), said, ``So far, industries have been rather passive in dealing with emission reductions, as is has been something that was considered to lie far off in the future. 
	
	
 ``We will first start gathering the opinions of business leaders regarding Korea's ratification of the treaty, while continuing to promote the development of energy-efficient technologies,'' he said, adding a special committee on climate change was formed under KCCI last January. 
	
	
 The international treaty to tackle climate change was first envisioned in Kyoto four years ago, but due to the conflicting interests of developed and developing countries as well as other contentious issues such as emission reduction mechanisms and targets, it is yet to go into effect. 
	
	
 The protocol faced danger of being shelved altogether, when the U.S, which is responsible for one-fourth of all CO2 emissions in the world, decided to abruptly withdraw from the climate change treaty last March. The Bush administration fears the treaty will have a negative effect on its economy and maintains that developing countries, such as China and India, should also be subject to mandatory emission targets. 
	
	
 But due to the strong initiative of the global community, led by the European Union, countries agreed on a set of rules to implement the climate change treaty _ with or without the U.S. 
	
	
 In order for the protocol to be implemented, it must be ratified by at least 55 parties, including enough industrialized countries to represent at least 55 percent of the total carbon dioxide emissions in 1990. 
	
	
 A total 43 countries have ratified he treaty so far, with Korea yet to ratify.

BEIJING, Nov 15 (AFP) - China on Thursday said it did not rule out taking part in any international peacekeeping force to maintain stability in Afghanistan. 
	
	
 ""We are ready to give sincere and earnest consideration to any effort that will contribute to stability and peace in Afghanistan,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue told reporters. 
	
	
 Her remark was in response to a question on whether China would be willing to participate in a multinational peacekeeping force in Afghanistan. 
	
	
 The issue of peacekeepers in Afghanistan has attained renewed urgency this week following rapid advances by the opposition Northern Alliance against the ruling Taliban militia. 
	
	
 Zhang said the Chinese government was not yet in direct contact with leaders of the Northern Alliance. 
	
	
 ""Together with the international community we are ready to work for regional reconciliation in Afghanistan and for regional stability,"" she said at a regular ministry briefing. 
	
	
 China has played a tiny role in a handful of recent United Nations peacekeeping actions in various parts of the world, including Cambodia.

Minister of Science and Technology Ronaldo Mota Sardenberg headed Brazil's delegation to the Seventh Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Marrakesh. 
	
	
 After four years of arduous negotiations, the Marrakesh conference ended successfully at 0600 hours last Saturday. Its objective was to complete the regulations governing the Kyoto Protocol and thereby create political and technical conditions for the latter's ratification by the international community. 
	
	
 With the protocol in effect, it will be possible to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the industrialized countries and, consequently, to combat the global warming of the atmosphere for the benefit and well-being of future generations all over the planet. 
	
	
 The problem is neither simple nor minor. A great many countries, including Brazil, are helping to improve our knowledge of the issue. The latest available scientific report states flatly that the global warming already observed--about 0.5 degree Celsius--is due to human activity and results from the emission of carbon dioxide and other gases. If nothing were done, the temperature of the atmosphere would rise by a few degrees this century with unmistakable and potentially disastrous effects. Particularly affected would be the world's poorer regions. 
	
	
 Brazil's objectives were fully achieved. The understanding prevailed that climate change is global and presents a challenge to the world's leaders. It had already been decided in Kyoto to set goals for reducing emissions, initially for the industrialized countries so that distribution of the resulting burden would be accepted as fair by all. 
	
	
 Now the international community is being forced to face reality: there is only one way to prevent those effects or reduce them to the minimum: emissions must be limited. But the cost is high and requires a change in the way energy is generated as well as in means of transportation and agricultural practices. 
	
	
 Since 1997, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has frequently interacted with other world leaders to overcome obstacles and open up paths to negotiation. A formidable deadlock occurred, however, at the meeting in The Hague at the end of 2000, and it seriously threatened the protocol's future. At a new meeting in Bonn in July of this year, thanks to the efforts of many delegations, including that from Brazil, which played a leading role, it was possible to isolate five areas for negotiation. 
	
	
 Only three important points were left over for Marrakesh. The first had to do with the legal status of the protocol, a question that had already been the object of a political accord in Bonn. But only now has it been possible to express the matter in satisfactory terms. The countries and even the companies involved won the assurance in Marrakesh that actual implementation of the protocol will be carried out in a legally binding manner. 
	
	
 The second big challenge was to regulate in detail the compensation mechanisms for reducing emissions. The one that interests us in particular is the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which applies to countries such as Brazil. The proper regulation as finally achieved represents a balance between restrictions on free use of the mechanisms so as to ensure that the reductions are real--that is, physical and not just bookkeeping exercises--and, at the same time, to keep some flexibility in the controls so as not to burden the compensation transactions excessively. It was possible to ensure the environmental integrity of the protocol and to maintain control over the mechanism. 
	
	
 The third big challenge concerns land use: a change in the way land and forests are used so as to prevent the inclusion of activities that do not lead to a real reduction in emissions. An example of this is the simple presence or aging of forests. The controversy over that subject contributed to the deadlock at the conference in The Hague last year, since the pressure to include such activities was very strong in view of their zero cost. 
	
	
 Brazil contributed greatly to the success in Marrakesh. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso spoke with his colleagues at bilateral meetings and emphasized to the French National Assembly and the UN General Assembly the need for multilateral diplomacy in dealing with a problem involving the basic principle of shared but differentiated responsibility on the part of all countries. 
	
	
 Also contributing were our talks with ministers of various key countries in the negotiations, ranging from China, India, Nigeria, Iran, and Argentina among the developing nations to Japan, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany among the industrialized countries. Also contributing was the excellent technical preparation and mature action of the Brazilian delegation, which consisted of experienced negotiators. Also contributing was the interested and well-organized participation of nongovernmental sectors in Brazil, including the private sector. Their participation was a demonstration, not always seen in other countries, that government and the private sector are working together in the country's interests. 
	
	
 The CDM Executive Committee will actually begin operating as soon as the Kyoto Protocol takes effect. The idea for the CDM originated, at least in part, in a concept successfully advocated by Brazil during the Kyoto negotiations in 1997. 
	
	
 Ever since a ministerial meeting in 1999, I have advocated that that mechanism begin its activities as quickly as possible, a step that was finally accepted in Marrakesh. Brazil was elected by consensus, and with the support of Latin America, to the CDM Executive Committee. 
	
	
 The Kyoto Protocol expresses the world's political will and is becoming the dominant norm in that field from the standpoint of international public law. Even the United States, which declared for its own reasons that it did not intend to ratify it, has been giving indications that it will adopt domestic measures using concepts capable of being harmonized with those set forth in the protocol. That will facilitate their possible convergence later with the international system. 
	
	
 President Fernando Henrique Cardoso announced at the United Nations that he would submit the protocol to the National Congress for ratification. It is predicted that a sufficient number of countries will do the same so that the protocol will take effect before the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in September 2002. That will be proof, on its 10th anniversary, of the success of the Rio Conference, where this whole important effort began.

 Seoul, Nov. 16 (Yonhap) -- The number of employees working on a temporary or daily basis have increased drastically as companies moved to slash labor costs after the financial crisis in 1997, the National Statistical Office (NSO) said Friday. NSO statistics showed that the number of workers employed on a temporary and daily basis rose by 888,000 to 6,962,000 in October compared with late 1997. The number working on a temporary basis went from 4,182,000 in late 1997 to 4,641,000 last month and that for those hired on a daily basis surged to 2,321,000 from 1,892,000 during the cited period. The number of full-time workers declined 626,000 to 6,525,000 during the same time span. ""Demand for those working on a temporary or daily basis is risiing because companies are trying to save labor costs amid the continued economic slowdown,"" an NSO official said. Over 90 percent of full-time workers receive retirement allowances and bonuses but the comparable numbers fell to 10 percent for temporary workers and 1 percent for those employed on a daily basis. About 80 to 90 percent of full-time workers were registered for the national pension, employment and health insurance systems while the comparable numbers shrank to 20 percent and 2 to 3 percent for temporary workers and those hired on a daily basis, respectively. hdh@yna.co.kr

 One in four children in the KwaZulu-Natal capital of Pietermaritzburg has been orphaned by Aids, and the number is set to rocket in the next 10 years. 
	
	
 A study by Dr Neil McKerrow, chief paediatrician at Pietermaritzburg's Metropolitan Hospitals Complex, shows that 50 000 Aids orphans live in the city. The number rises to 100 000 if surrounding areas in the Midlands are included. 
	
	
 McKerrow estimates that the number of orphans in the Midlands will top 250 000 by 2010. 
	
	
 His figures refer to children under 16 who have lost their mothers, in line with a World Health Organisation definition. According to Statistics SA, the city has 193 000 children in that age group out of a total population of 573 000. 
	
	
 Although there are care centres and orphanages in Pietermaritzburg, McKerrow's study found that extended families and the community were willing to take in these children. 
	
	
 Six years ago McKerrow and a colleague at the Edendale Hospital, Annelise Verbeek, pioneered a study entitled Models of Care for Children in Distress, a term they coined for abandoned, displaced and orphaned children in the region. 
	
	
 They found that 6% of children in Pietermaritzburg were Aids orphans. Six years later, the number has risen to 25%. 
	
	
 At an informal meeting three weeks ago, the city council was told that, according to estimates from teachers, there were now as many as 100 000 Aids orphans in the city, but city health officials say these numbers appear to be too high. 
	
	
 McKerrow's estimates are based on household counts coupled with mathematical models used by the WHO. 
	
	
 KwaZulu-Natal has the highest rate of HIV infection in SA, with 36% of the population infected. McKerrow estimates there are 4.6 million orphans countrywide. 
	
	
 Yvonne Spain, the co-ordinator of Children In Distress, a network of more than 50 organisations and people, said communities were absorbing the children, ""but the fact of the matter is that, as multiple deaths occur, that safety net will fall apart"". 
	
	
 The director of the provincial Aids Action Unit, Dr Sandile Buthelezi, admitted the city faced ""quite a problem"" and suggested this week the figures might even be higher than McKerrow's. 
	
	
 He said: ""The number of orphans is not a static thing. . . Every day an orphan is being created and I know the problem is enormous in the province."" 
	
	
 Buthelezi said the provincial health department was working closely with the welfare community and the private sector to secure funding for bodies working with Aids orphans.

 Seoul, Nov. 19 (Yonhap) -- The recent settlement of details regarding the Kyoto Protocol is putting local exporters on alert. The Kyoto Protocol was made by members of the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change at its seventh session held in Marrakech, Morocco at the start of the month. If the protocol, which prescribes an obligatory reduction of greenhouse gases, is put into effect, the nation's export will be heavily damaged. The Kyoto Protocol is an agreement to get 30 leading industrialized countries such as Japan and members of the European Union (EU) to lessen greenhouse gas emissions by amounts as high as 95 percent of levels in the 1990's. The government and business circle expect the nation's exports to be damaged in direct and indirect ways from 2008, when advanced nations will begin to be regulated by the protocol. The reason is that South Korea's industrial structure depends heavily on the export of products including not only durable appliances such as air conditioner but also automobiles all of which should meet intensified environmental standards before they can be shipped overseas under the Protocol. Also, advanced nations are likely to make use of the standards as a new trade barrier. Moreover, the pressures from advanced countries to get South Korea to cut its greenhouse gas emissions is expected to strengthen. South Korea ranked ninth on a list of the largest greenhouse gas producers, and Korea's per-capita emissions were also close to those of advanced countries. Under this situation, the nation cannot possibly avoid pressures to match the cuts of advanced nations. In particular, Japan and European countries are likely to persuade developing countries including South Korea to take part in the reduction of greenhouse gases earlier than planned in an attempt to secure the United States' ratification of the protocol. The U.S. backed out of the agreement, saying its industries would be handicapped by stringent rules that developing countries could simply ignore. Even though South Korea declared its intention to discuss its duty to cut down greenhouse gases from 2018, there is little possibility that advanced nations will wait until then. If things go on like this, the government must transform the current industrial structure into an environment-friendly one and minimize industries which use a host of energy such as petrochemicals and cement manufacturing. The government will have to pour a lot of money into businesses to promote energy efficiency. According to an April survey of 416 firms across the country conducted by the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), 60 percent of total respondents said the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change will greatly influence local firms But only 28.4 percent replied that they are rushing to conform to the protocol's requirements. ""The government should provide domestic firms real aid like tax reductions and environmental technology development rather than abstractly recommend domestic firms promote energy efficiency and lower energy consumption,"" an industry source said. Unless measures that comply with the Kyoto Protocol are mapped out early, the nation's competitiveness in manufacturing sectors will weaken soon. sunglok@yna.co.kr

HONG KONG, Nov 21 (AFP) -- The number of south Asians seeking political asylum in Hong Kong is on the rise following the US-led military campaign in Afghanistan, it was reported Wednesday. 
	
	
 Some 200 South Asians, most claiming to be businessmen, had sought political asylum from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Hong Kong between August and October, double the total number applying over the past seven years, the mass-circulating Chinese paper Oriental Daily News said. 
	
	
 Most of the claimants were from Pakistan, while the rest were from Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Indonesia. They entered Hong Kong through the Chek Lap Kok international airport or from Lo Wu checkpoints with the mainland. 
	
	
 A spokesman for the security bureau said Hong Kong would not grant anyone political asylum under present policies. 
	
	
 The senior management of the Hong Kong government, however, was shocked by the surge and was worried that some people might use it as a means to remain in Hong Kong indefinitely, the report said. 
	
	
 It said the immigration department had already been instructed to step up its checks on suspicious travellers. 
	
	
 The world's refugee problem was thrust back into the global spotlight in September following Australia's refusal to accept 438 mainly Afghan refugees rescued from a leaking ship and stranded at sea for days. 
	
	
 Hong Kong closed its last refugee camp, for Vietnamese migrants, last year after the 1,400 remaining boat people were allowed to remain. They were left over from the surge of some 230,000 refugees into the territory following the fall of Saigon in 1975. 
	
	
 The territory spent 8.7 billion dollars looking after them.

Researchers from the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot and the Technion in Haifa have developed a computer so tiny that a trillion of them could fit into a laboratory test tube. The ""computers"" are biological molecules, using DNA for software and enzymes for hardware, and can solve a billion mathematical problems a second. 
	
	
 Such tiny devices could one day fit into cells and supervise biological processes, or even synthesize drugs. DNA strands exist in almost every body cell -- they are biological software that tell each cell and molecule what to do. 
	
	
 ""If you look at the mechanism of a cell, a lot of what goes on inside is computation. We don't need to teach the cell new tricks, we just need to put the existing tricks in the right order,"" says Prof. Ehud Shapiro of the Weizmann Institute, who headed the research. 
	
	
 Some scientists believe DNA-based computers could have an advantage over existing computers based on silicon chips. Artificial chips have reached their limits and can't get any smaller. But, say the scientists, tiny DNA strands can store huge amounts of information in minuscule space -- one cubic centimeter of DNA can store more information than a trillion CDs. 
	
	
 Prof. Shapiro says the molecular computer is the first of its kind. Although computers with DNA input and output have been made before, they have always involved a laborious series of reactions, each requiring human supervision. ""Previous biological computers were the same size as the room in which the supervisors and computer equipment worked,"" said Shapiro. ""With the new method, all you need do to get an answer is put all the ingredients into a test tube, mix them together, and check to see what the output is."" 
	
	
 For now biological computers only know how to answer simple questions with a ""yes"" or ""no"" response. A typical question would be: In the sequence ""AAB"" is there an equal number of As and Bs? 
	
	
 Nevertheless, several researchers worldwide have hailed the computers as an important new development. ""They work better than anything I've seen so far,"" said Eric Baum, a computer scientist at the NEC Research Institute in Princeton, New Jersey. Although he questions whether biomolecular computers will ever become really useful, he believes they are a ""step in the right direction."" 
	
	
 Professor Shapiro and a growing number of other scientists believe DNA-based computers may lead to a number of useful applications -- they could be planted inside cells, where they would watch for irregularities or even synthesize drugs. 
	
	
 The computer simulates the cell's natural mechanisms with an accuracy level of 99.8 percent. Natural DNA processes also involve inaccuracies which are corrected by other genes, says Shapiro, and it is almost impossible to reach absolute accuracy using biological systems. However, for the uses for which the computers are designated, this level of accuracy is adequate. 
	
	
 So how does such a computer work? Let's say the computer wants to know whether the number of times a ""B"" DNA type appears in a DNA section is odd or even. The DNA section -- the ""input"" -- is inserted into a chemical solution along with enzymes to be used as the computer's ""hardware"". Other DNA sections are added, which act as ""software"". 
	
	
 A software section sticks to the input with the help of an enzyme. If the tip of the input is ""B"", the input will be labeled as having an odd number of ""B"" sequences. Another enzyme then cuts the section and reveals the next sequence. Each time ""B"" appears, the label on the input changes from ""even"" to ""odd"" and back again. Once the computer has dissected the entire input, it can determine whether the sequence appeared an even or odd number of times according to the last label -- the ""output"". 
	
	
 The computer can also do other calculations, such as checking whether the ""B"" sequence appears at least once, or at most once, by inserting different types of software DNAs.

ISLAMABAD, Nov 24 (AFP) - Japanese Foreign Minister Makiko Tanaka held ""warm"" talks here on Saturday with a senior UN official on the refugee crisis in Afghanistan and the hazards facing those wanting to return, a Japanese official said. 
	
	
 The talks focused on the need to rehabilitate Afghanistan to pave the way for the safe return of the estimated four million Afghan refugees living in neighbouring countries, foreign ministry spokesman Daisuke Matsunaga said. 
	
	
 He told a news conference that Filippo Grandi, regional emergency coordinator for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), had thanked Japan for its contribution to international efforts to aid the refugees. 
	
	
 ""The talks were very warm,"" Matsunaga said at the end of the meeting. 
	
	
 He added that Grandi had outlined to Tanka a four-pronged approach to the crisis -- improving conditions in camps, expanding the UNHCR's ability to deal with any further refugees, assisting non-governmental organisations involved in dealing with the crisis, and encouraging refugees to return to their homes. 
	
	
 Returning refugees, however, faced minefields, a lack of educational facilities and ruined irrigation systems. 
	
	
 These problems would have to be dealt with under international plans to rebuild Afghanistan, which is estimated may cost 10 billion dollars and may take, Grandi told Tanka, three to four years to achieve. 
	
	
 In the meantime, however, the UNHCR, through its Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance to Afghanistan (OCHA), was trying to provide tents, clothing and heaters to returning refugees as well as to displaced people within the country wanting to return to their towns and villages. 
	
	
 Tanka, who arrived in Pakistan on Friday for talks on the reconstruction of Afghanistan and to reward Islamabad for its role in the war against terrorism, was due to meet Pakistani counterpart Abdul Sattar later Saturday and President Pervez Musharraf on Monday. 
	
	
 Japan has taken a leading role in the international drive to rebuild Afghanistan and in January is to host a meeting of finance and foreign ministers from more than 22 countries to build a platform for commitments to rebuild a country shattered by more than two decades of war. 
	
	
 It has offered financial support to Pakistan, including the rescheduling of around 550 million dollars in debt and the provision of about 40 million dollars in emergency budgetary and refugee assistance. 
	
	
 Since the terrorist strikes in the United States, more than 135,000 refugees have crossed into Pakistan, but the United Nations says the true figure is much higher. 
	
	
 Even before September 11, Pakistan was playing host to an estimated 2.5 million refugees who had fled Afghanistan through 22 years of war and ethnic bloodshed.

MANILA, Nov 24 (AFP) - President Gloria Arroyo praised Malaysia on Saturday for the swift arrest of Muslim leader Nur Misuari, whose forces embarked on a fresh rebellion this week in the southern Philippines. 
	
	
 Arroyo was ""very satisfied that the Malaysian government has been efficient enough to arrest him,"" her spokesman Rigoberto Tiglao told DZBB radio here. 
	
	
 Foreign department spokesman Victoriano Lecaros said the arrest should serve as ""a warning to terrorists that they will find themselves on inhospitable ground within ASEAN,"" referring to the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations. 
	
	
 Tiglao separately told AFP that Manila would hold talks with Kuala Lumpur on the deportation of the former guerrilla leader turned politician. The neighbors lack an extradition treaty. 
	
	
 He suggested that Kuala Lumpur would have to take the initiative, saying that Misuari had apparently violated Malaysian law by entering the country without a passport. 
	
	
 Manila wants to put Misuari on trial for rebellion in connection with a revolt on Monday which claimed at least 113 lives. 
	
	
 The Philippine foreign ministry this week cancelled Misuari's regular and diplomatic passports as a Jolo court ordered his arrest. 
	
	
 He is the founder of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) group and governor of the Muslim self-rule Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). 
	
	
 Misuari launched his revolt after Arroyo decided to back an MNLF rival in an election to be held Monday to choose the next ARMM governor. 
	
	
 The government has deployed thousands of troops to Jolo to deter attempts by Misuari followers to disrupt the balloting. 
	
	
 Malaysia's official Bernama news agency said that Misuari and six of his men were arrested on an island off the Malaysian state of Sabah, which is on Borneo island, while trying to enter the country illegally. 
	
	
 A source at the Malaysian embassy in Manila said the Royal Malaysian Police intercepted Misuari's speedboat and arrested all its occupants. 
	
	
 The boat was being checked for weapons, said the source, who would not be identified. 
	
	
 Malaysia, which had given sanctuary to Misuari and his guerrillas in the early 1970s, has called on Misuari to end a bloody six-day-old rebellion by his followers in the southern Philippine island of Jolo. 
	
	
 Lecaros, from the foreign ministry, said the arrest was a sign that the ASEAN, ""particularly Malaysia, is succeeding in the effort against terrorism."" 
	
	
 The group pledged to counter terrorism at a summit in Brunei this month as well as a summit with their main trading partners in Shanghai in October. 
	
	
 ASEAN includes Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. 
	
	
 Lecaros said that Misuari had developed ties with the Abu Sayyaf rebel group that has carried out a spree of kidnappings. 
	
	
 US and Philippine officials say the group has links with Saudi militant Osama bin Laden, blamed for the September 11 attacks on the United States that killed about 4,000 people. 
	
	
 ""Misuari is not just any lawbreaking person,"" Lecaros said. 
	
	
 ""The Philippine government has information that Mr. Misuari has of late developed some links with the Abu Sayyaf about whom more need not be said,"" he said. 
	
	
 Bernama quoted Malaysian police chief Norian Mai as saying police would try to hand Misuari and his men over to the Philippine government as soon as possible. 
	
	
 Tiglao said he had been informed that Misuari was taken to the Sabah state capital of Kota Kinabalu. 
	
	
 He expressed the government's determination to put Misuari in jail. 
	
	
 ""Definitely,"" he said. ""We have to enforce the law.""

Regular British troops will not be sent to fight the Taliban, Robin Cook signalled tonight. 
	
	
 His remarks came as the militia began talks on surrendering its spiritual home of Kandahar after Northern Alliance troops finally entered Kunduz. 
	
	
 SAS [Special Air Service] soldiers and their American counterparts are fighting alongside the Alliance as they have swept across large swathes Afghanistan. 
	
	
 But Commons Leader Mr Cook said: ""If you look back over the past month there has been no situation in which we have put British troops into the ground civil war and I don't myself imagine that's going to change."" 
	
	
 British troops remained on 48 hour stand-by but the situation was ""better than anybody could have hoped for"", according to Mr Cook. 
	
	
 ""We will continue obviously to keep the situation under review, but frankly, I think we should welcome the fact that their presence has not been needed in Afghanistan. This is not a reverse, it's actually an advance,"" he added. 
	
	
 News of the Kandahar negotiations came after the Taliban control crumbled in their final northern stronghold of Kunduz following mass surrender. 
	
	
 The city's top Taliban commander was among thousands of Afghan and foreign troops who gave themselves up after days of talks interspersed with fighting. 
	
	
 However, night fell before the Alliance could secure the city, increasing the danger of militants fighting back. 
	
	
 Hours after the vanguard entered from the west, a tank column halted its advance from the east, fearing hostile fire. 
	
	
 The surrender took days to hammer out, primarily because hard core Taliban and foreign troops from Usama Bin Ladin's al-Qa'ida terror network did not want to give up. 
	
	
 The fall of Kunduz leaves Kandahar as the Taliban's last major stronghold following the rapid collapse of their regime across the majority of the country. 
	
	
 Hundreds of foreign fighters captured in the siege of the northern city were killed in a prison riot at a fortress outside Mazar-e-Sharif, the Northern Alliance said. 
	
	
 But that did not stop Taliban commanders discussing the surrender of Kandahar, following calls from 70 Afghan tribal leaders for them to avert bloodshed. 
	
	
 ""There are some talks and negotiations going on there (in Kandahar) with the Taliban to surrender themselves,"" Gen Mohammed Zaer Azimi said in Herat. 
	
	
 Ruud Lubbers, the United Nations Commissioner for Refugees, said Afghanistan was not yet secure for aid agencies to operate in and ""not enough"" food had been taken into the country. 
	
	
 ""It is not at all a secure environment,"" he told the programme. 
	
	
 ""So although our international staff went back to Kabul and hope to go back to the other places ... one cannot say it is safe in the country and secure enough. 
	
	
 ""So there is quite a job to be done in creating a secure environment for humanitarian assistance."" 
	
	
 His concerns echoed those voiced by leading charity Oxfam, which said instability across the country was hampering aid efforts. 
	
	
 But the Prime Minister's official spokesman today said Tony Blair was pleased with the progress that had been made on the military, diplomatic and humanitarian fronts. 
	
	
 ""The situation obviously remains fluid from hour to hour but it seems to be going in the right direction,"" the spokesman said. 
	
	
 The campaign so far showed Alliance military success was the best way of getting food in, he said. 
	
	
 He again stressed that Britain would need to see evidence before it became involved in military action in other countries. 
	
	
 ""In terms of the war on terrorism we have always said this is a multi-faceted campaign but equally we have also said any future military action would have to be based on evidence,"" he said. 
	
	
 ""This campaign is not over. We are still in the middle of fighting the war in Afghanistan.""

Brussels - New confidential documents indicate that current Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and the army's former leadership were directly responsible for massacres in the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila in 1982. Lawyers for the survivors, who have filed a complaint against Sharon in Belgium, said this. 
	
	
 On behalf of some Palestinian survivors, lawyers Luc Walleyn and Michael Verhaeghe on 18 June filed a complaint with the Brussels Public Prosecution Office against Sharon and other Israeli and Lebanese persons deemed responsible for the massacres in Beirut. 
	
	
 A few days after filing the complaint, the lawyers received a stack of documents in Hebrew and in English regarding the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon and the Sabra and Shatila events. The documents include meeting reports, and intelligence service and interrogation reports. The lawyers refused to reveal the source of the documents. 
	
	
 Judging from a few texts that De Standaard was given access to, the documents seem to be related to the Israeli Kahan Commission. This special commission investigated the Sabra and Shatila events in 1982-1983. It published a report, but not all the documents and interrogation reports were released, because they were deemed damaging to the state's interests. 
	
	
 Walleyn are Verhaeghe are convinced of the authenticity of the documents. They gave the entire stack to Investigating Magistrate Patrick Collignon. The lawyers expect that the Public Prosecution Office will request Israel to confirm the documents' authenticity. 
	
	
 It had already been known that Lebanese Phalangist militias, which perpetrated the massacres, cooperated closely with Israel, but according to the lawyers, various documents now indicate that Israel and the Phalange had planned the actions in the camps in advance, that Israel exercised complete control over the militias, and that, in the wake of the massacres, the Israeli army instructed the Phalange to assume responsibility. ""In practice, the Phalangist militias operated directly under Israeli command. Senior generals and Sharon bore command responsibility [preceding two words published in English] for the militias' actions. According to Belgian and international criminal law, they could be held responsible,"" Verhaeghe said. 
	
	
 Tomorrow, the Chamber for Indictments will begin the debate on Investigating Judge Collignon's questions on the legitimacy of the case against Sharon. A ruling is expected by the end of this year or early next year. 
	
	
 In the meantime, the lawyers have also initiated a civil suit against Elie Hobeika, the militia leader who is regarded as one of the main perpetrators of the massacres. In the complaint, Hobeika had not yet been called by name. The lawyers deemed it wise to do this now because one of Collignon's questions is connected with the juridical consequences of a Lebanese amnesty law.

 Moscow, 27 November: Russia intends to modernize and extend the service life of 11 power units in its nuclear power stations by 2005. This is one of the provisions of the federal programme Energy-Efficient Economy that covers the period from 2002 to 2005 and sets guidelines until 2010, the Government Information Department reported on Tuesday [27 November]. The programme calls for the overhaul of nuclear power stations with a view to extending their safe and efficient operation, extending the service life of power units, resumption of the construction of power units and compiling a list of promising sites for future nuclear power stations. Its other provisions include the overhaul and construction of new plants for making fuel elements and the overhaul of ""wet"" nuclear waste storage facilities. In the next stage, 2006-2010, the efficiency of existing nuclear power stations will be stepped up by increasing the utilization of current capacity, extending their service life and increasing capacity by using new-generation power units In 2005, the capacity of all Russian nuclear power stations should total 25.24 GW. It will increase by 3 GW in 2002-05 and by 4.81 GW in 2006-10 to 30.05 GW. When nuclear power stations account for nearly 20 per cent of total energy generated in the country, nearly 52bn cubic metres of gas will be saved in 2005 and 65.5bn cubic metres in 2010. The construction of nuclear power stations in Iran, China, India, Kazakhstan and Ukraine will provide 42bn dollars in 2002-2005 and 24bn dollars in 2006-2010.

 Moscow, 29 November: Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has arrived in Moscow to attend the 10th anniversary summit of the Commonwealth of Independent States, said upon his arrival on Thursday [29 November] that ""certain apathy"" to the commonwealth has developed in the CIS member countries. Making his point clear, he said that the former Soviet republics ""have not completely fallen apart, but have not formed a sufficiently strong alliance on a new basis either"". He said, however, that a real unification will take place after all, since the CIS countries have far more reasons for a union that the European Union countries. He said this tendency reflects the economic and cultural traditions of the CIS countries which were formerly part of the Soviet Union. The current summit will hopefully allow the CIS countries to lay new ways towards rapprochement. Concerning the delimitation of the border between Kazakhstan and Russia, Nazarbayev said that this process is continuing without any disagreements and with mutual respect for each other's interests, and that documents on the final delimitation are likely to be signed next year. Getting back to the problem of broadening all-round cooperation between the CIS countries, Nazarbayev said that a new factor - globalization - is accelerating this process. ""We cannot stand on the sidelines of this global tendency,"" the Kazakh president said.

Since the 11 September events in America, that country's administration has severely restricted the civil rights of the American people, particularly the foreigners residing in that country. It has done so through passing the anti-terrorism law, issuing presidential directives, and sending secret memoranda to the judiciary under the pretext of fighting terrorism. One such measure was a directive issued on 23 November concerning the creation of military courts for trying immigrants and foreigners suspected of involvement in terrorist activities. This has drawn a chorus of condemnation from the democrats in Congress, foreign governments and civil right activists in that country. According to the directive, which is considered by many American lawyers to be in contravention of the country's constitution, judicial investigations into the cases of the defendants in military courts will be conducted without any possibility of bail. Nor will they be allowed to appeal to American or international courts. Currently around 1,100 suspects, who are chiefly from Islamic Middle Eastern states, are being held in detention. They have been divested of many of their basis rights, and their voices cannot be heard by anyone. The decision by Bush to create a military court for the trial of terrorist suspects has prompted European states, particularly Spain, to refuse to hand over to America more than 10 individuals suspected of belonging to terrorist groups. They fear that these suspects may not receive a fair trial in America. America, which always accuses other countries of violating human rights, is today placing terrorist suspects, who may even be innocent, in solitary confinement without access to any means of mass communication, thus depriving them of the basic human rights, in contravention of its own constitution. And, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, it violates human rights - rights which are global. In the 23 November directive, Bush has in effect drawn a clear line between the rights of American citizens and foreign immigrants. This is a blatant case of discrimination in rights - something which is not practised anywhere else in the world. It is worth mentioning that in the past America had severely criticized and put pressure on other governments in the world for trying terrorist suspects in military courts. The American State Department had in 1999 condemned the government of Peru for the creation of a secret military court, and called on that country to accept international regulations, such as the need for open and fair trials and observance of defendants' basic rights. The recent action of the American president clearly demonstrates the need for the American administration to observe human rights. Moreover, it places this country, which claims to be a forerunner in the sphere of human rights in the world, in the same rank as countries which restrict civil rights under the pretext of security considerations. It appears that if the directive issued by Bush becomes law, then that country's re-entry into the UN Human Rights Commission, from which it was expelled this year, will become much more difficult.

STRASBOURG, Nov 29 (AFP) -- Three leading international organisations warned jointly Thursday [29 November] that the international fight against terrorism should not be a pretext for the violation of human rights. 
	
	
 The Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said they were responding to recent ""worrying developments"" in some countries regarding human rights following the September 11 attacks. 
	
	
 ""While we recognize that the threat of terrorism requires specific measures, we call on all governments to refrain from any excessive steps which would violate fundamental freedoms and undermine legitimate dissent,"" a joint statement issued in Strasbourg, Geneva and Warsaw said. 
	
	
 UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, Walter Schwimmer, Secretary General of the Council of Europe and Ambassador Gerard Stoudmann of the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights said it was essential ""that states strictly adhere to their international obligations to uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms"" in the fight against terrorism. 
	
	
 Robinson, a particularly critical voice in guarding against human rights abuses in the wake of the September 11 attacks, said Wednesday the war on terrorism was taking a heavy toll on civil liberties. 
	
	
 The statement comes two days after the British House of Commons passed emergency legislation allowing the detention of terrorist suspects without trial, and the killing of hundreds of Taliban inmates in a prison uprising in Mazar-i-Sharif in northern Afghanistan earlier this week. 
	
	
 The killings prompted a call by London-based rights group Amnesty International for an inquiry into the affair. 
	
	
 All three groups said it was essential that governments strike a balance between ""legitimate national security concerns and fundamental freedoms that is fully consistent with their international law commitments."" 
	
	
 The statement listed what it said were essential rights that could not be hollowed out because of the fight against terrorism. 
	
	
 These were: the right to life, freedom of expression and religion and freedom from torture, while it also urged that the retroactive imposition of more severe penalties for crimes be avoided. 
	
	
 The United States earlier this week hinted it may expand its war against terrorism beyond Afghanistan to Iraq, bringing swift criticism from both Germany and France, who called for restraint in the future of the military campaign.

 Taipei, Nov. 29 (CNA) -- Thirty political observers from around the world are slated to participate in an international symposium on democratic consolidation, peace and security to be held in Taipei Sunday. 
	
	
 The experts and scholars will be divided into discussion panels that will address the significance of Taiwan's elections and its democratic consolidation, a comparative analysis of democratic elections and Taiwan's democracy in the Asia Pacific region. A roundtable discussion will also take place. 
	
	
 According to the Government Information Office (GIO), which is co-sponsoring the symposium with National Chengchi University's Institute of International Relations, the symposium is being held to provide the world with a greater understanding of Taiwan's role in regional stability. 
	
	
 The GIO added that Taiwan's accomplishment in democratization is the ""best role model"" for mainland China's progress toward democracy. 
	
	
 Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen is scheduled to deliver a keynote speech at the symposium to explain the government's policy toward mainland China. 
	
	
 Some of the visiting experts from 10 countries, including the United States, Canada, Britain, Germany, France and Japan, have been arriving since Wednesday to call on key government agencies and local political leaders ahead of Saturday's elections for legislators, county chiefs and city mayors. 
	
	
 In a meeting with 25 of the scholars Thursday, Tsai said in response to a question on whether Taiwan is afraid of over-reliance on the mainland market that the island will be able to achieve balanced economic growth as long as it strikes a balance between maintaining its sovereignty, developing its economy globally and normalizing relations with the mainland.

Beijing 10 Nov (Xinhua) -- Expert's View on Global Climate Change Protocols 
	
	
 The seventh Conference of the Parties (COP 7) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held in Marrakesh, Morocco, from 29 October to 9 November. Dr. Ren Guoyu, an expert meteorologist at the National Climate Center of China, pointed out that the Kyoto Protocol was only the first step to resolve global warming during his interview with Xinhua News Agency. He indicated that there is a long way to go and a great deal of effort to put in before global warming can be successfully arrested. 
	
	
 According to Dr. Ren, humans released excessive amounts of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere in the past century, particularly in the past 50 years. Carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere is higher than any time in the past several hundred thousand years. This excessive emission of greenhouse gases has caused the mean global temperature to rise by 0.4 to 0.8 degree C in the past 140 years. If emission of greenhouse gases is not rigorously limited and is allowed to continue to climb, then the average global temperature may surge by 1.5 to 5.8 C. The sea level will rise by nine to 88 millimeters. It will be disastrous to many countries. In addition, global warming will bring about frequent extreme weather phenomena, such as cold spells, heat waves, torrential rain, and tornadoes, to threaten our society. He also warned that an abrupt climate change might take place when a critical value of temperature rise is exceeded. In certain regions, the temperature may rise suddenly and sharply. In other regions, it may fall precipitously. It will have a deleterious effect on mankind. This disaster can only be averted if we all join in to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to stop global warming. 
	
	
 According to this expert, the United States is the largest greenhouse gas-emitting country in the world. And its total emissions continue to rise. In March, the new Bush Administration openly declared it would rescind its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the ""Kyoto Protocol."" Its excuses include that it will harm the US economy and there is insufficient participation by developing nations. Dr. Ren was critical of this irresponsible decision by the US Government. He indicated that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is accumulated over the past 100-200 years. The amount of greenhouse gases emitted by most developing nations in the past several decades only represents a small fraction of the total emission. This increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is caused by industrialized nations. Furthermore, on a per capita basis, emissions by developing nations are also far less than that by industrialized nations. China's per capita emission is only one-sixth that of the United States. It mainly requires the joint effort of industrialized nations to resolve global warming. It is a mistake for the United States to use such an excuse to evade its responsibility. 
	
	
 He also pointed out: Although the Kyoto Protocol did not set a reduction target for China, however, China is very concerned about global climate change-related issues in recent years. It has significantly reduced greenhouse gas emissions by efficiency improvement, energy conservation, and development of advanced energy technology. Its effort is well recognized around the globe. 
	
	
 To implement the Kyoto Protocol, according to Dr. Ren, usually a country would incur an economic loss equivalent to 1 percent of its GDP when it tries to lower greenhouse emissions 1 percent. There is no way for a weak, developing nation to absorb such a burden. It needs monetary and technical assistance from industrialized nations. However, to protect their own interests, a few industrialized nations repeatedly made outrageous demands in past UNFCCC conferences. In the Bonn conference in July, Japan even made new demands regarding the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Finally, a compromise was reached after developing nations and the EU made a significant concession. The Kyoto Protocol was significantly weakened as a result. During this conference, countries such as Japan, Russia, Australia, and Canada played the same tactic again to try to delay the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. The United States continues to refuse to fulfill its obligations. Negotiation was stymied. In order to implement the treaty as soon as possible, developing nations and the EU agreed to a compromise. However, future negotiations are not expected to be smooth either. 
	
	
 As a reminder, Dr. Ren pointed out: The Kyoto Protocol is merely a gesture for mankind to stop global warming. Fundamentally, the targets set by the Kyoto Protocol are far less than what actually will take to effectively curb global warming. The Kyoto Protocol will officially be implemented after Earth Summit 2002 to be held in September in Johannesburg, South Africa. Mankind should continue to work on a solution to global warming. The next step will be even more difficult. It is a long road ahead of us. Dr. Ren suggested that developing nations should also join forces in emissions reduction in the future.

For 10 days, the second Belgian astronaut will get to the International Space Station [ISS] on board the brand new Russian Soyuz TMA-1 space ship. 
	
	
 On Thursday [29 November] the Belgian Government formally committed itself, vis-a-vis its Russian and European partners (the European Space Agency [ESA]), to pay Frank De Winne's ticket into space. The highway to the stars is looking radiant for the Belgian ""cosmonaut."" 
	
	
 The formal agreement regarding Frank De Winne's flight with the Russians was signed in Brussels on Thursday by Charles Picque, the Minister for Science Policy, and his government commissioner Yvan Ylieff. 
	
	
 The document, a letter sent to both the ESA (European Space Agency, to which Frank De Winne currently reports) and the Russian Rosaviacosmos space agency, guaranteed the payment by Belgium of the expenses tied to this space trip. So on 4 November 2002, that is to say, in a little less than one year, the second Belgian to reach space will take off from the Baikonor cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on board a brand new Soyuz space ship: the TMA-1. It is a ship that is more modern and bigger than the current Soyuzes. 
	
	
 On it Frank De Winne will serve as the on-board engineer. So he will be the second most qualified crew member on board, behind the on-board comander, who still needs to be appointed by the Russian space authorities. This appointment is not expected for a few weeks. So, if that should prove necessary, De Winne will be able to personally pilot the space ship. This is a first on a ""TMA,"" which attests to the confidence the Russian and European partners have put in him. 
	
	
 An example? In Brussels on Wednesday [28 November], the French astronaut Claudie Haignere, who had just completed a flight in space together with the Russians that in every way was identical to the one scheduled for De Winne, could not find enough praise for our fellow citizen, with whom she trained for several months in Moscow. 
	
	
 ""Frank worked at Star City with much intensity. In several weeks, he learned the indispensable bases of the Russian language. He is making appreciable efforts to meet the other foreign cosmonauts who are in training there and share his experiences. His dynamism is an asset. People there are really unanimous about him,"" she told us. 
	
	
 ""This assessment confirms us in our choices,"" a delighted Ylieff said. 
	
	
 Some Particularly Financial Choices 
	
	
 As is known, Frank De Winne's taxi flight lasting about 10 days comes with a price tax: some 600 million [Belgian] francs (15.5 million euros). This is an amount that Belgian yesterday pledged to pay to Russia. An initial segment of 2.5 million euros (Frank's training costs) will reportedly be paid in the next few days. 
	
	
 Several avenues have been explored to collect the overall amount. The latest, and also undoubtedly the most logical, is internal to the SSTC, the federal Scientific, Technical, and Cultural Services, which, in particular, manage the country's space budgets. 
	
	
 The sum in question will come from the SSTC's space budgets and be deducted in several years (two or three). The SSTC's overall budget will not suffer from this. Nor will the space sector's in particular. 
	
	
 Cancellation Insurance 
	
	
 ""Budgets will remain constant,"" explained Eric Beka, the SSTC's secretary general. The sums obtained will result from the assignment of a portion of the space budget to this mission (and its many related scientific fall-outs) rather than to other optional programs. 
	
	
 In a word, De Winne's ticket into space has been financed. And his ""parachute"" too. ""Since there is no other Belgian astronaut at the ESA who is capable of replacing Frank De Winne for this mission if it suddenly proved impossible for him to carry it out, we are also expecting to take out 'travel insurance' for our 'cosmonaut,'"" Yvan Ylieff also said. ""This should insure that we can recover the sums involved, that in the prospect of another space trip."" One million euros will be devoted to this ""cancellation"" insurance. 
	
	
 About 10 years ago, Dirk Frimout was the first Belgian astronaut to go into earth orbit. That was with the US Atlantis shuttle. In a few weeks the second Belgian to go up there will don a Russian cosmonaut's space suit. It will be a mission that will be rich in promises. De Winne will thus qualify technically in space piloting. He will become one of the best elements in the corps of European astronauts. In addition, he will carry the projects of Belgian scientists and industrialists active in the space sector far. As Picque emphasized, ""for many years, each franc invested by Belgium in space has brought in three francs."" Who said that space investments were not interesting?

Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, 6 Dec (AFP) -- A pollero (immigrant smuggler), suspected of having facilitated the entry into the United States of illegal aliens from the Middle East, was arrested and is being investigated by the United States and Mexico, the authorities informed this Thursday. 
	
	
 Attorney General Francisco Cayuela confirmed that preliminary investigations indicate that the gang of Mexican Saul 'El Guero' Medina specialized in smuggling illegal aliens from the Middle East, in addition to car theft. 
	
	
 Medina, who was arrested in the Mexican city of Matamoros off the Gulf of Mexico and which borders Brownsville (Texas, mid-south), is being investigated by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Guillermo Narvaez, Tamaulipas Ministerial Police Chief of Police, confirmed. 
	
	
 The Ministerial Police discovered that the ""El Guero"" Medina's gang operated from Matamoros and had branches in India, Brazil, Guatemala, Pakistan, Honduras, and El Salvador. 
	
	
 Narvaez explained that the FBI has requested information on this gang, which used false documents such as resident cards, licenses, social security numbers, and seals of the State of Texas Justice Department. 
	
	
 The US authorities began to investigate this gang's activities and its possible connection with the 11 September terrorist attacks, after the arrest of a group of Brazilians and another group of Iranians in Texas in October. It was also discovered that these illegal immigrants were carrying false documents. 
	
	
 Saul Medina was arrested in Matamoros and had 14 stolen vehicles in his possession. He was also safeguarding 9 illegal aliens, among them one of Indian origin.

BAGRAM, Afghanistan, Dec 7 (AFP) - In a foretaste of resistance to foreign peacekeepers by the Northern Alliance, an uneasy atmosphere reigns between US forces and their Afghan allies at the Bagram airbase north of Kabul. 
	
	
 Once the main Soviet airbase during Moscow's 1979-89 invasion of Afghanistan, Bagram has now become the hub for flights into the country as Kabul's own airport cannot be used because of unexploded US bombs. 
	
	
 Although Northern Alliance control the main entrance to the base, some 60 kilometres (35 miles) north of Kabul, just inside the perimeter there is a checkpoint manned by heavily-armed US soldiers. 
	
	
 A few feet (metres) ahead down the road, British commandos are on guard duty. 
	
	
 A contingent of the US 10th mountain division has taken up base at Bagram, joining some 150 British Marines, to establish a humanitarian air corridor for international aid but also to ensure security at the crucial airbase. 
	
	
 ""By no means are we trying to set up a permanent presence here, we just want to help,"" said US military spokesman Sergeant-Major Ray Cordell. 
	
	
 But the ill-disciplined alliance troops showed little-disguised irritation at the Americans' dominant role at Bagram, refusing to allow journalists through to speak to the US soldiers. 
	
	
 The top alliance commander in the area, General Babajan, driving out of the base to inspect positions along with some US and British officers, good naturedly shrugged off any problem. 
	
	
 ""Our cooperation? It is good, you can see they (the Americans) are here,"" he said smiling. But then asked about permission to visit the base, Babajan replied: ""You have to talk to the Americans, they're in charge here."" 
	
	
 The balance of authority became clear when the general invited journalists to accompany the military convoy, an order swiftly countermanded by the US officers. 
	
	
 At the checkpoint, five US soldiers armed with M-4 carbines were manning the post, assisted by a sniffer dog. 
	
	
 The US military will not say how many troops they have brought to the base but their presence has already provoked an armed incident. 
	
	
 A group of journalists who toured Bagram accompanied by US soldiers on Wednesday were halted in their tracks by a burst of gunfire by alliance soldiers next to their vehicle. 
	
	
 ""When it gets to the point that Northern Alliance troops start firing in the air just next to a car with reporters, you have to do something about it,"" said Cordell. 
	
	
 He said that Northern Alliance commanders were irritated by images of armed US soldiers on Afghan soil, and so media access to the base had to be temporarily suspended. 
	
	
 ""They don't want their people to see pictures of foreign troops in Afghanistan,"" he said. 
	
	
 But the spokesman also admitted that the US troops reminded the Afghans of the Soviet military invasion. 
	
	
 ""We have the same caps as the Soviet soldiers, that brings back bad memories for the Afghans,"" said Cordell. 
	
	
 Ironically, some 200 armed Russians, who appeared to be from the military although they were dressed in uniforms of Russia's emergencies ministry, set up camp 10 days ago in the centre of Kabul. 
	
	
 Moscow said they are there to help re-establish its embassy and deliver humanitarian supplies. 
	
	
 But Russia, which armed the alliance throughout its five-year civil war with the Taliban, has offered unequivocal political support for the loose coalition of ethnic minorities which swept into Kabul on November 13. 
	
	
 Under the power-sharing accord signed in Bonn on Wednesday, which should see a new interim government take power on December 22, a mainly Muslim UN-mandated security force is to be deployed in Kabul. 
	
	
 However Northern Alliance defence minister General Mohammad Qasim Fahim said the same day that he had rebuffed a British offer to send troops to Kabul in the coming days and insisted he wants a strictly limited UN force.

Osaka, Dec. 7 Kyodo -- A Japanese nongovernmental organization (NGO) in Kobe shipped relief goods such as blankets and sweaters to Afghan refugees at refugee camps in Pakistan on Friday to help them endure the severe winter weather. 
	
	
 Packages of the relief goods, collected by the Asia Africa Cooperation Environment Center (ACEC), went through customs in Osaka. They will be shipped to Islamabad on Tuesday from Narita airport, east of Tokyo, ACEC officials said. 
	
	
 At the request of the Red Crescent Society of Pakistan, ACEC has called for donations of relief goods on its Web site since early November. 
	
	
 On Friday, ACEC shipped some 200 kilograms of the 50 tons of relief goods it has collected. The rest of the goods will be shipped by sea early next year, the officials said. 
	
	
 ACEC is also calling for monetary donations because it needs more money to pay shipping costs, the officials said.

Following the end of the Cold War, the United States has become the world's sole superpower and the trend of pragmatism in its foreign policy has become clearer and clearer. Pragmatism is, in the first place, the United States' traditional policy. After coming to power, unilateralism and pragmatism have become Bush's main foreign policy line. Alternate use of and complementary nature of pragmatism and unilateralism constitute the characteristics of the Bush administration's diplomacy. 
	
	
 Once coming to power, Bush insisted on deploying the National Missile Defense System [NMD]. The international community and even US western allies, including US neighbor Canada, have consistently opposed the plan. Despite the opposition, Bush went it alone. One of the main US diplomatic goals for this year is to persuade the international community to accept the NMD and Russia to agree to revise the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty [AMD] by flashing a carrot on a stick. At one time, he said the new US missile defense system would not pose a threat to the international security and would not trigger an arms race; on another occasion, he stated the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty signed by the Soviet Union and the United States in 1972 was ""a product of the Cold War era,"" and thus has lost its binding force. He even claimed that to develop the NMD, the United States would be even prepared to scrap the ABM. Over the past year, Bush increased funds for research and testing for the N!
MD and accelerated the test frequency of the anti-missile system. Even after the adoption of the resolution on ""maintaining and abiding by the ""Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty"" on 29 November at the 56th United Nations General Assembly, the United States still persisted in carrying out a fifth missile interception test. In a word, the US development of the NMD is for the purpose of ""attacking other countries and at the same time preventing other countries from attacking it,"" thereby genuinely securing its status of being the ""sole super power."" 
	
	
 The Sino-US plane collision event that occurred on 1 April can best illustrate the US alternate application of the ""two-isms"" in its diplomacy. In the plane collision event, if one goes by the US logic, only the US spy plane is permitted to spy at other people's doorsteps; the host, on the other hand, does not even have the right to look after its doors and to protect its yard. The responsibility for the event, in which a Chinese plane crashed and a Chinese pilot perished, lies completely with the US side. The US side not only refused to apologize to China but also claimed that ""US crew members were detained by the Chinese side."" It was only because of it being deterred by the Chinese Government's firm position and due to the fact that the US crew members were still in China that the United States was compelled to offer an apology. But after the Chinese side released all the US crew members, major US political figures changed their stance immediately and threatened to use human rights, trade, and Olympics hosting issues to ""retaliate"" against China. 
	
	
 Since coming to power, Bush, proceeding from the US immediate interests, has also adopted the pragmatism and unilateralism position with regard to international treaties. This March, catering to the interests of the US oil and coal barons who have made large political donations to the Republican Party, Bush announced, without prior consultations with its allies, that the United States would not enforce the ""Kyoto Protocol"" which is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the world. This announcement was met with unanimous condemnation by the international media. 
	
	
 In July, the Bush administration decided to let the ""Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty"" ""freeze"" in the Senate. Hard on the heels of that decision, the US negotiation representative Marie Chevrier announced in Geneva that the Bush administration would not support the implementation of the ""Biological Weapons Convention"" and that the United States strongly objected to the concrete enforcement plan of this convention. 
	
	
 The Bush administration either refuses to sign, ratify, or implement international treaties or asks for their revision. It only wants the international treaties that benefit the US security and economy and globalization. It does not want anything to do with the international treaties, mechanisms, and organizations that restrict or prevent US freedom. It does not want anything to do with countries and organizations that do not follow its orders or that always cause troubles to it. 
	
	
 After the 11 September attacks on the United States, the international community strongly condemned the terrorist acts and expressed sympathy and support to the American people. Supported by the world, the United States launched the ""war against terrorism"" of this century. Bush stressed that the war is not only the ""US war"" but also a ""world war."" The United States views itself as a ""major force of anti-terrorism,"" for in the world only the United States has the capability to carry out the global war against terrorism. Bush said, ""Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists"" and ""any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime."" The United States wants all the countries in the world to stand behind it in the fight against terrorism and decides which country is its enemy or friend on the basis of that country's attitude toward it. It is in fact like using multilateral diplomacy to enhance US unilateralism. But the United States obviously practices pragmatism in its treatment of Pakistan -- a frontline state in the fight against Pakistan. Before the 11 September event, the United States kept its distance from Pakistan and imposed sanctions on it. But after declaring a war against terrorism the United States not only drew Pakistan to its side but also provided aid to it. Whether the United States will continue to treat Pakistan in a responsible manner, it is anybody's guess.

For its own reasons, which are linked to its interests and, naturally, to Israel's interests, the United States chose to put intensive pressure on the Palestinian Authority. It wanted the PA to meet difficult, even impossible, security conditions. It also tried, through this pressure, to remove the legitimacy of the PA and its chairman Yasir Arafat under the pretext of terrorism or support for terrorism. This US position, which is fully biased to Israel, strengthened Israeli Prime Minister Ari'el Sharon's attempts to suppress national Palestinian ambitions and achieve his declared objective of establishing Israeli security on the rubble of the legitimate Palestinian rights. 
	
	
 It would have perhaps been logical and acceptable if Washington had demanded a mutual and concurrent cessation of the ongoing violence between the Palestinians and the Israelis and called on Israel not to exploit the calm to open the files of security revenge through assassinations and arrests. It would have been logical and acceptable if Washington had asked Israel to announce its commitment to the principle of withdrawal from the territories it occupied in 1967 and to end the settlement activity. Such demands constitute the strong base for bringing about calm and stability, putting a final end to violence and terrorism, and turning a new leaf toward fruitful negotiations leading to a just peace acceptable by all sides. 
	
	
 The situation and its tragic repercussions are being viewed only from the Israeli perspective. The killing of hundreds of Palestinians and the increase in the number of martyrs among children are being ignored. And the destruction of homes, installations, and PA infrastructure is being overlooked. This does not serve the interest of peace and the security of the peoples of the region in the long run. On the contrary, it heightens the sense of frustration among all sectors of the Palestinian people and damages the credibility of the United States as a sponsor of the peace process, indeed as an effective partner in the settlement negotiations from the start of the peace process in the late eighties until this process faltered as a result of Israel's intransigence after Sharon came to power. 
	
	
 The United States realizes that the Palestinians are serious in their efforts to achieve a just peace. The Palestinians left no avenue unexplored in their quest for a settlement that enables them to regain their legitimate rights and provides all the peoples of the region, including the Israelis, with security and stability. It is, therefore, unfair to blame the PA for the tension, and sometimes violence, that takes place as a result of the Israeli oppressive measures and activities. Every oppressive or vindictive Israeli action has a Palestinian reaction that cannot be stopped. Before 1994, Israel was in control of all the occupied Palestinian territories and yet it was unable, despite all its forces, weapons, and measures, to achieve full and comprehensive quiet in the West Bank and Gaza throughout 27 years. 
	
	
 In this context, we must note the role of all Arab and international forces in curbing Israeli military operations against Palestinian cities and residential areas and in explaining the true picture of the situation to the United States. Certainly, the intensive efforts that our big sister, Egypt, made to bridle the Israeli oppressive activity and to warn the Israeli prime minister against targeting President Arafat and the PA are highly appreciated by the Palestinian people in particular and the Arab nation in general.

 In perfect agreement with the latest polls on the popularity of President Hugo Chavez, the most recent study by Alfredo Keller has confirmed the resounding and sustained fall of the approval rating the President had at the beginning of his administration. 
	
	
 The study was conducted among a sample of 1,000 adults from different socioeconomic groups in Caracas, Maracaibo, Valencia, San Cristobal, Barquisimeto, Maracay, Barcelona, Puerto La Cruz, Puerto Ordaz, and Maturin. 
	
	
 The most telling result is that more than half of those polled believe that it is necessary to remove Chavez from office to solve the crisis. From this group, 49 percent believe that a hypothetical replacement of the chief of state should take place through the institutional channels, whereas 5 percent agree with using forceful means. 
	
	
 Against this 54 percent, 43 percent of those polled prefer to let him govern until the end of his term in 2007. 
	
	
 The recorded trend on the President's approval rating also registered a drop. Whereas his approval rating reached 84 percent and his disapproval rating reached 11 percent in April 1999, both ratings crossed one another at 46 percent in August of this year. This November, his disapproval rating reached 58 percent and his approval rating, 33 percent. 
	
	
 This result also reflects the collapse of the myth of a polarization between rich and poor, which applied at the beginning of his administration. According to this, only 20 percent believe the rich and powerful are against Chavez. However, 78 percent of those polled believe there are many poor who oppose him. 
	
	
 This study shows a very clear pronouncement in favor of calling a referendum to redraft the Constitution and restore the balance of power: 75 percent agreed with the referendum, whereas 20 percent rejected it. 
	
	
 Although Chavez' edge in voter's preference continues to shrink, the effects of a divided opposition still keep him in first place (which shows the strength of radical Chavez supporters). Given several names of possible presidential candidates, 25 percent voted for the current leader; 21 percent for Henrique Salas Romer; 16 percent for Julio Borges; 13 percent for Alfredo Pena; and 5 percent for Francisco Arias Cardenas. 
	
	
 [Caracas El Universal (Internet version) in Spanish on 8 December carries a related 153-word report that indicates: ""The latest polls conducted by four of the country's leading firms show a drop in the popularity of President Hugo Chavez. According to Datanalisis' November poll, 57.4 percent of those polled feel as bad or worse than in the past and 55.3 percent believe their main problems are in the economic area. The population's disapproval of the government's job reaches 93 and 88.4 percent on the insecurity and unemployment problems, respectively. If the elections were held tomorrow, Chavez would still win, but his lead collapsed from 40 to 24 percent. Popular support for [Caracas Mayor Alfredo) Pena climbed from 5.5 to 16.8 percent."" 
	
	
 Caracas El Universal (Internet version) in Spanish on 9 December carries a related 684-word report that indicates: ""According to Luis Christiansen, director of Consultores 21 polling firm, President Chavez is facing two of the four key ingredients for the decline of any government: Unresolved major problems and a drop in the leader's popularity. The third is the perception of the President as an incapable leader, which is already happening, and the fourth is that Venezuelans are able to find a substitute leader. The first factor deals with the nation's general mood. Venezuelans' level of optimism is currently the same reported in 1998; that is, they are feeling pessimistic. The difference is back then, Chavez' candidacy raised expectations. This lasted two years and people are feeling pessimistic again. To the president's misfortune, 80 percent of Venezuelans believe there is a solution for the unemployment problem. As Christiansen explains, 'if Venezuelans did not see unemployment as a problem that could be solved, they would not blame it on Chavez' incapacity. Four of every 10 Venezuelans are blaming this problem on him.' As for the second factor, 43 percent find nothing positive in the government's actions. Chavez' strengths include his personal qualities (27 percent) and clear desire to work (17 percent). In other words, Christiansen points out these are the strengths of a campaigning candidate instead of a president with three years in office. The fact that two-thirds of Venezuelans consider Chavez responsible for the country's problems shows that he is losing strength in the third aspect of stability: The President's ability to keep hope is shrinking. Finally, the Consultores 21 analyst notes that today, the number of extreme Chavez opponents (42 percent) is larger than that of extreme Chavez supporters (18 percent), which could bring about a confrontation for power. He added that Chavez still leads voter's preference with 28 percent.""]

Tehran, Dec 9, IRNA -- Tehran-based Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) on Sunday expressed concern about return of the period in which force and weapon had the last say in international relations. 
	
	
 The IHRC said in a statement to mark December 10, ""international day for human rights"" that the international community has formulated numerous documents to honor human rights after 50 years of bitter experience and the heavy losses that the humanity has suffered. 
	
	
 The statement said that several hundred documents have been signed to promote human rights and different cultures have put forward their outlooks about human rights and envisaged measures to stop violation of human rights. 
	
	
 The IHRC called for prohibition of discrimination, torture, arbitrary detention and honoring the human rights, political rights, the rights of associations, the women's rights as well as the rights envisaged in the international declaration for human rights as recommended by the divine religions several centuries ago. 
	
	
 The statement regretted that provisions of the international declaration for human rights have not been materialized. ""The human communities have suffered heavy human losses in the course of devastating world wars and understood that any progress in human communities is dependent on honoring the human rights,"" it said. 
	
	
 The IHRC said that the international conference against racism in Durban, South Africa August 31-September 7, 2001 was a turning point in the international campaign to honor human rights. 
	
	
 The statement deplored the injustice against the Palestinian nation and violation of human rights of political activists, journalists, the religious minorities, the children and women in some parts of the world. 
	
	
 The IHRC said that all nations and religions condemned the September 11 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. The solidarity would bring about an international campaign to dry up the roots of terrorism and expand peace and security in the international community, but, certain countries resort to military power and embark on trampling upon human rights of civilians. 
	
	
 The statement urged the statesmen in different countries to heed the religious teachings calling for respect for human rights and said that no peace will be established without honoring human 
	
	
 Meanwhile, in another development, the Geneva-based United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson called on Israel to stop bombing the Palestinian targets in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and allow in international monitors.

SPENDING on information technology in Saudi Arabia is expected to reach over $5 billion by the year 2005, according to Dr Mohamed Al-Amri, managing partner of the Dr Mohamed Al-Amri &amp;amp; Company, provider of auditing, accounting, tax services and IT consulting. 
	
	
 He said the bulk of this spending will be on software and services. Saudi businesses today are looking into software applications that will help them retain their clients, expand their market reach and cut down of their operating costs, Dr Al-Amri said in a press statement issued Sunday to the Gazette. 
	
	
 He said that growth on Saudi Arabia s IT spending expected to rise by 34 percent in the next four years will bring Saudi-based businesses capabilities to compete on national and international markets. 
	
	
 According to Dr Al-Amri, the top priority of Saudi businesses these days is the application of customer relationship management (CRM) capabilities. He said the Kingdom is now part of that increasing global spending on CRM, which is projected to hit the $10 billion mark by the year 2005. 
	
	
 Dr Al-Amri said that the growth of Internet in the Kingdom, coupled with the thrust of national companies seeking regional exposure and global competitiveness, is pushing Saudi-based companies to develop web-based strategies for a wider market reach at manageable costs. 
	
	
 Software for e-business and e-CRM capabilities are now being applied by many Saudi companies. Dr Mohamed Al-Amri &amp;amp; Company is the first local company, with Kingdom-wide offices, to become a certified e-CRM ACCPAC partner. 
	
	
 Worldwide revenues in the CRM services markets will increase to over $126.2 billion in 2004. The e-CRM is the use of technology to support customer interactions with little or no human intermediation from the business side. It consists of the use of direct-to-customer channels, through mainly e-mail and the World Wide Web (WWWW), along with other emerging technologies such as WAP.

AMMAN (JT) -- The Higher Court of Justice on Monday held the first session of a case filed by opposition parties contesting the recently endorsed temporary Elections Law. 
	
	
 According to the parties' lawyer, Rateb Juneidi, the court presided by Judge Abdullah Hadad, examined the charge sheets and arguments presented and adjourned until Dec. 31. 
	
	
 The Opposition Parties' Higher Coordination Committee had contested the temporary law on Sept. 16, on the grounds it was ""unconstitutional."" 
	
	
 The parties argued that there were ""no emergency circumstances"" warranting the enactment of a temporary law on elections. The Constitution allows the executive branch to issue temporary laws in the absence of Parliament, provided there is a ""state of emergency."" 
	
	
 The law, which clarified voting procedures but maintained the controversial one-person, one-vote formula, was endorsed by the government in July, just over a month after the dissolution of the Lower House. 
	
	
 Political parties and professional associations have also moved to contest several temporary laws including the one on public gatherings, as well as amendments to the Penal Code

The expenditure has not increased much from 2000, since during that year it totalled Fr3.255 billion. The financial impact of operations in Afghanistan, which are expected to mobilize some 5,000 men, will not take effect until 2002. Outside Afghanistan, and outside Africa, under the terms of its defense agreements, France has deployed in 2001 some 10,750 members of its Armed Forces and of the gendarmerie, most of the personnel being stationed in Kosovo (5,890) and Bosnia-Herzegovina (2,820.)

 Taipei, Dec. 11 (CNA) -- Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said Tuesday she foresees the possibility of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait resume dialogue next year. 
	
	
 Tsai made the remarks during a meeting with a delegation of the ""Committee of 100,"" a New York-based non-partisan association of ethnic Chinese celebrities. 
	
	
 Noting that President Chen Shui-bian has on many occasions expressed goodwill to mainland China, Tsai said so long as Beijing leaders can carefully mull the significance of Chen's statements on cross-strait affairs, particularly the ""one China"" issue, there should be opportunities for the two sides to resume talks. 
	
	
 ""It all depends on how mainland China interprets President Chen's latest remarks on cross-strait relations and how the two sides cultivate an environment favorable for resumption of their long-stalled dialogue,"" Tsai explained. 
	
	
 While meeting with the ""Committee of 100"" delegation Monday, President Chen said ""one China"" is an issue that can be discussed in the future with mainland China. However, Chen said ""one China"" should not be a precondition for talks until such time as Taipei and Beijing have reached a mutually acceptable meaning for the the term through ""wisdom and creativity."" Chen also told the visiting members of the overseas Chinese group that the so-called ""one China"" was originally not a problem according to the Republic of China Constitution. The problem, he went on, is that the so-called ""one China"" principle cherished by Beijing ""makes the Republic of China vanish."" Therefore, as a guardian of the ROC sovereignty, dignity and security, he cannot accept the principle. 
	
	
 Tsai said cross-strait dialogue is not expected to resume overnight. 
	
	
 ""The two sides must forge mutual trust and work out certain procedures to ensure that talks are conducted on a solid basis,"" Tsai noted. 
	
	
 In her view, Tsai said, both sides have been endeavoring to prevent the results of Taiwan's recent parliamentary and local government chief elections from affecting the stability of cross-strait relations. 
	
	
 Tsai said although the spokesman for mainland China's Taiwan Affairs Office failed to give any positive response to Taiwan's goodwill in his first post-Taiwan election news conference, he appeared to be fully aware of the importance of maintaining stability in the Taiwan Strait. 
	
	
 The nation's top mainland policy planner also assured her guests that the government's policy toward mainland China will remain unchanged after the ruling Democratic Progressive Party emerged from the recent legislative elections as the island's largest party in the Legislative Yuan for the first time. 
	
	
 Tsai left for the United States Tuesday evening to brief American scholars and politicians on Taiwan's political situation and policy direction in the wake of the Dec. 1 elections.

ANKARA, Dec 15 (A.A) - Interior Minister Rustu Kazim Yucelen released a decree on Saturday, and announced measures to be taken against illegal migration by sea. 
	
	
 The decree said that human smuggling incidents from the Turkish coasts to Greek islands, Italy and France increased recently due to economic, social and political reasons. 
	
	
 It said that the Coast Guard units had intercepted a total of 6 thousand 743 foreigners since January 1, 1996. 2,816 of these foreigners were captured in the first 11 months of 2001. 
	
	
 The Coast Guard Command has been working on a report to give detailed information about its activities against human smuggling and number of foreigners intercepted between January 1 and November 26, 2001. 
	
	
 According to the report, Turkish and Greek flagged ships, fishing boats and speed boats were used by human smugglers. 
	
	
 ``Most of the illegal migration incidents by sea happened in western provinces of Izmir, Aydin and Mugla. 28 out of 63 incidents were reported in Bodrum township of Mugla. These incidents generally increase in spring and fall. Turkish citizens from southern and southeastern provinces accounted for 31 percent. Iraqi and Afghan immigrants followed them. Having regard to the fact that 95.1 percent of foreign immigrants were coming from African and Middle Eastern countries, it becomes more difficult to prevent illegal migration from under developed countries to European countries via Turkey,`` it added.

Today, in order to find a correct solution to the Middle East issue, it is important to frustrate Israel's territorial ambition and create conditions for Palestine to create an independent state of its own. Apart from this, we cannot talk about the settlement of the Middle East issue. 
	
	
 The great leader [suryong] Comrade Kim Il-song taught: 
	
	
 ""Imperialism is the source of war and the disturber of peace."" 
	
	
 It is an urgent matter for Israel to withdraw completely from the occupied land of Palestine. 
	
	
 Israel makes itself appear to be withdrawing its troops from some of the occupied Palestinian autonomous areas. On 17 November, Israeli troops pulled out of Tulkarm, a West Bank area of the Jordan River. 
	
	
 However, this is no reason to be optimistic about the situation. 
	
	
 Toward the end of October, Israel declared that it would withdraw from some of the Palestinian autonomous areas where the situation was ""relatively calm"" and pretended to be abiding by the decision. However, it stopped withdrawing its troops halfway through under the pretext of ""unstable situation"" and occupied them again. There is no way of knowing whether or not Israel will halt the withdrawal of its troops again under any pretext as it did before. 
	
	
 On 18 November, the following day Israel began withdrawing its troops from Tulkarm, Israeli troops deliberately gunned down two Palestinians in the Palestinian autonomous areas as if they were quarries. On 20 November, the Israeli army bulldozed dwelling houses in the Palestinian autonomous area and even committed such an atrocious act as wounding Palestinians without hesitation. As a result, the situation has become tense again. 
	
	
 It was in fact due to strong international pressure that Israel began withdrawing its troops from the Palestinian autonomous area. 
	
	
 In September last year Israeli Prime Minister Sharon, the then leader of the opposition party, visited a holy place in Kuds [Jerusalem], throwing Israel and Palestine into a fierce fight. Sharon's remarks and behavior that were insulting to the Palestinians infuriated Palestine. The desperate fight even took tolls of women and children. 
	
	
 The clash between Israel and Palestine briefly appeared to be abating in the wake of the large-scale attack incident [taesupkyok sakon] against the United States. However, it has become fierce again after Israeli minister of tourism was assassinated. Taking advantage of this, Israel occupied six cities located in the Palestinian autonomous areas by the use of force. 
	
	
 The United Nations and many countries around the world began paying attention again to the situation in the Middle East that is becoming more complicated. International pressure is on Israel again. 
	
	
 Caving in to the international pressure, the United States pretended to support the creation of an independent Palestinian state. The United States, which is currently waging a war in Afghanistan, tried to shore up support from Arab states and Islamic world through a crafty ruse. Seeing through the US scheme, Israel refused to continue the troop withdrawal from the Palestinian autonomous area. 
	
	
 Israel has never abandoned its aggressive ambitions. 
	
	
 Convinced that the United States can never abandon it completely, Israel is dragging its feet on the withdrawal of troops citing a variety of excuses. 
	
	
 Israel is adamantly against the creation of a completely independent Palestinian state. Israel's scheme is to make Palestine a vassal state and bring it under its control. This is why Israel agreed to discuss the issue of granting independence to Palestine on conditions that Palestine claim only a small piece of territory and waive its right to raise [organize] a regular army. 
	
	
 As such, Israel's territorial ambition is persistent and clever. 
	
	
 The US administration is about to call on Israel to support the creation of a Palestinian state with East Kuds as its capital. 
	
	
 Commenting on this, many Arab states and international opinion emphatically said that it is nothing more than a political stratagem to win support for its war in Afghanistan and to further expand the sphere of its domination in the Middle East. 
	
	
 The United States, which has been in the van of invading other countries, is about to put pressure on Israel, not because it is now more sympathetic to Palestine or finds Palestine more tolerable than before, but because of its own national interests. 
	
	
 It is quite obvious that Israel will employ a crafty trick in the future to realize its burning territorial ambition. It is also obvious that the aggressive US policy toward the Middle East will remain unchanged. 
	
	
 The prospect for the settlement of the Middle East issue is still bleak due to those who stand in the way of the settlement.

The great leader [yongdoja] Comrade Kim Chong-il has pointed out: 
	
	
 ""Although the imperialists and reactionaries speak ill of socialism and pretend to be the 'advocates of human rights,' they are the ones who really abuse human rights."" 
	
	
 At a recent United Nations meeting, the United States picked a quarrel with us by speaking as if our country had a ""human rights problem."" This was not the first time the United States acted this way. More often than not, the United States, acting as if it were an ""adjudicator of human rights,"" published the so-called ""Annual Human Rights Report"" and ""Annual Report on International Religious Freedom,"" attempting to teach a lesson or two to countries -- including our country -- it deems disagreeable. 
	
	
 The United States, however, is not qualified to speak of ""human rights"" in other countries. One can easily talk in a similar manner of the racial discrimination in the United States which is becoming more serious with the passage of time. Many people in the United States have their human rights ruthlessly trampled upon simply because they are colored. 
	
	
 According to a poll conducted jointly by the US daily ""The Washington Post"" and Harvard University, people are wondering whether the American society is not reverting to the 1960s when racial discrimination was very serious. A total of 1,709 people, including blacks, Latinos, and Asians, participated in the poll. They responded that three out of ten blacks could not find job or have been denied responsible positions in the workplace simply because they were blacks and eight out of ten blacks and two thirds of the Latinos and Asians said they had suffered persecution and had been subjected to abusive language. 
	
	
 Ali Barr [name as published], a black man working at a TV station in Atlanta, has recently experienced racial discrimination in a restaurant. When Ali Barr and his company entered the restaurant, ten white people inside the restaurant appeared surprised to see them and a waitress told them to leave the premise immediately. Recalling the scene, Ali Barr said: ""Myself and my company were racially discriminated against. I can never forget what I saw that day as long as I live."" 
	
	
 As a result of racial discrimination, many among the ethnic minorities reportedly have been driven out of urban areas. According to 2000 vital statistics released not so long ago in the United States, one out of four residents of the suburban areas was an ethnic minority. This figure is said to be 5 percent higher than it was a decade ago. 
	
	
 People will likely remember the fact that the United States withdrew its delegation from the UN conference against racism held last September in Durban, South Africa. In the beginning, the United States refused to send a delegation, but eventually dispatched a low-level delegation. When voices critical of the Israelis' violation of the Palestinian people's human rights were raised at the conference, the United States went so far as to withdraw its delegation. 
	
	
 Since this is how a government claiming to represent its people behaves in international settings, it is no wonder people at home follow the government's example. 
	
	
 Instead of talking about ""human rights issues"" of other countries, the United States should find out how things are in its own house where the abuse of human rights is rampant and make effort to rectify the practices.

These days, when everything seems to be collapsing in the Middle East, both the Palestinians' chances of finally having a state in which their people would be sovereign, and the Israelis' chances of integrating themselves into a region where -- need we be reminded? -- the Arabs are in the overwhelming majority, we believe it our duty to voice a few basic truths. 
	
	
 One of us is a Palestinian patriot (and not a nationalist). The other has no other homeland than France, which does not, however, lead him to deny his heritage from ancient Israel (which contains, like all heritages, the best and the worst) nor to be indifferent to the destiny of those millions of Jews who have something in common with him. 
	
	
 We are both historians. 
	
	
 However, we will not look back at the entire century that has just passed. There was a quarrel concerning Zionism. Those involved in it had no shortage of arguments, whether Arab, Jewish, or simply clear-headed. Zionism established itself in a sensitive region of the world at a time when nothing seemed more ""normal"" than to settle in someone else's territory. 
	
	
 The United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand were all created at the conclusion of a colonial process. 
	
	
 No one today challenges their existence despite the crises arising from this process and which were cited by an Aboriginal athlete at the Olympic Games in Sydney. 
	
	
 Likewise, the more recent creation of Israel was accompanied, under the indifferent gaze of the Western and Soviet world, by the forced exodus of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. Today, these refugees and their descendants do not call into question the existence of the state of Israel as long as the injustice suffered is recognized and the implementation of their rights is negotiated fairly. 
	
	
 Let us content ourselves with reiterating the evidence: Since June 1967, the West Bank and Gaza have been occupied and dominated territories, crushed politically, socially, economically. Despite this, the Palestinian resistance has formally recognized the existence of Israel and begun a peace process in Oslo, while the state of Israel has recognized the Palestinians represented by the PLO and its leader Yasser Arafat. 
	
	
 This process has not achieved its goal. 
	
	
 On the Palestinian side, feeding on the growing frustration of the occupied population, a wing has broken off, conducting a policy of terror and death that horrifies us. 
	
	
 On the Israeli side, despite the process, settlement has increased considerably, eating away at the supposedly autonomous Palestinian territories crisscrossed by ""bypass roads."" 
	
	
 Today, two forms of terrorism fuel each other. Palestinian terrorism, which existed on a very small scale in the time of Yitzhak Rabin, has taken on a dramatic dimension. But the Israeli response, with its ""extra-judicial liquidations,"" is even more dramatic in a certain sense. It now resembles the destruction of the very people, so structured and organized is it. 
	
	
 Like any form of state terrorism, it is above all contradictory. Yesterday, Yasser Arafat was being asked to police the area he was supposed to be in charge of, while destroying the instruments of his power. Today, he is being completely isolated and the desire to drive him away is scarcely disguised. 
	
	
 Ariel Sharon's immediate exploitation of the 11 September massacres is an unmistakable sign. Sharon compared Arafat to Bin Ladin and Mullah Omar put together. Whom does he think he resembles, if not the perpetrator of the Sabra and Shatila massacres? 
	
	
 How to escape from this situation? From the current perspective, three solutions seem ""logical."" 
	
	
 The first is the expulsion of the Palestinians from what is known as Eretz Israel, from all of Mandatory Palestine. A recently assassinated minister favored this solution. Can we seriously imagine the crimes that would have to be committed to achieve this result? Can anyone believe that the Arab world could approve of it? What would then remain of the universal character of the prophets of Israel -- that of the second Isaiah, for example -- and of Israeli citizens' hope of one day living in peace in this region? 
	
	
 The other solution is the opposite of the first one: the departure of the Israelis to more hospitable climes, in the United States or Europe. It is absolutely impossible for the time being. But in the future? What would remain of the ideals of those who saw themselves as their liberators of their people and as builders? Asking this question at least serves as a reminder that, although many have already left, thereby reinventing the Diaspora, the Israelis want to stay and do not intend to end up like French Algeria. 
	
	
 The third solution consists of coexistence, whether it takes the form of two separate states or a federation or a confederation. 
	
	
 Two basic principles could still, perhaps, make it possible. 
	
	
 The first is that of not only civic, but also social and economic, equality. This principle applies primarily to the attitudes that must prevail during any future negotiations. It also applies for Palestinian citizens of Israel who, 53 years after the creation of the state, are still far from equal. It furthermore holds for the Israelis who decide to remain in Palestinian territory and who must no longer be encysted there. 
	
	
 The second is that of reciprocity. Any renunciation of sovereignty by either party must be compensated by the other. This applies to all the problems under discussion, including, of course, the issue of Jerusalem and of the refugees. 
	
	
 It must be acknowledged that the government of Ariel Sharon has so far taken the opposite tack and that, while he has grudgingly recognized the Palestinians' right to a state, it has been under conditions such that this state, reduced to a series of Bantustans, has no chance of living and developing peacefully. Extremists on both sides have clearly understood this and have derived nothing but encouragement from it. 
	
	
 The Israeli ambassador in France, Elie Barnavi, recently made two contradictory statements: That all those who, like Nurit Peled, believe that the Sharon government is a ""government of death"" could easily fit into a telephone booth... and that by their existence they constitute Israel's very honor. 
	
	
 We still want to hope that the ""rest of Israel,"" as the prophets called it, is the ""mustard seed"" another prophet referred to. 
	
	
 We do hope so, against all hope.

December 5, was a Wednesday like any other for the 24 executive directors of the International Monetary Fund [IMF]. Three meetings - on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays - under the chairmanship of the institution's director general, Germany's Horst Kohler, usually punctuate their weekly schedule. During these meetings, they review various subjects and in particular the achievements of ""under program"" countries. That particular morning, it was Argentina's turn. It is the victim of an explosive situation at the economic, political and social levels. And yet, the problem was disposed of in two hours. Since the economic targets the government had promised, particularly the one on a zero budget deficit, were not reached, the board felt it was unable to ""recommend"" releasing a new $1.264 billion tranche that had been scheduled for December as part of last year's $22 billion program for Argentina. 
	
	
 Shortly thereafter, the institution's spokesman, Thomas Dawson, declared ""the [Argentine] authorities have to reach the program goals they set for themselves"" before they can get any more money. Moreover, he found the measures taken by the government to control the [movement] of foreign exchange and limit the flight of capital were ""regrettable"", even though these measures were made more flexible later on. According to an eyewitness, this cut and dry, accounting-like decision taken by civil servants, who thus have the power of ""life or death"" over a country, was not the subject of any debate. It was taken following the presentation of a report by Chile's Thomas Reichmann, the chief of mission who had been sent to Buenos Aires. The figures spoke for themselves. At most, a few differences in sensitivity emerged over whether or not the issue should remain closed from one to two months or if the discussions with Argentina should continue. The latter was adopted in the end. This was the only concession made to a government that has been struggling to restructure its domestic public debt to avoid having the country simply default on its debt. 
	
	
 Unconditional Support 
	
	
 In essence, it seems that they all agreed on one thing: meeting a commitment is inviolable. This position is surprising all the same because the history of the IMF is lined with derogations. We have stopped counting the number of times financial bailout plans have been set up to help this or that government in difficulty. We also stopped counting the unconditional support the institution has given some heads of state, who are neither especially virtuous nor especially democratic, because it was in the political, commercial and economic interest of the United States to do so. 
	
	
 This was the case in particular for Russia, Brazil and now Pakistan. In the case of Russia, it was a matter of helping the former soviet giant consolidate its emerging democracy. For Brazil, the Fund intervened in October 1998, between two rounds in the presidential election, to support Fernando Henrique Cardoso's reelection because his macroeconomic options fell in line with the Fund's requirements, contrary to his leftist adversary, Luis Inacio ""Lula"" da Silva. In the case of Pakistan, it is this country's geostrategic position in the current crisis that serves to justify the avalanche of loans and trade facilities that are being granted to Islamabad. 
	
	
 Argentina has none of these worthy arguments. Yet, over the past ten years, it has done everything it can to be considered one of the IMF's good pupils. The government adopted a fixed parity between the dollar and the peso in 1991 in order to stop unrestricted inflation. Buenos Aires privatized, on Washington's recommendation, all of its public companies. The government, without assets to sell and without the possibility of falling back on the devaluation of its currency, is now condemned to keep on asking for foreign capital to maintain its balance of payments in equilibrium. Hence, a foreign debt of $130 billion and the urgent need for an inflow of capital from the IMF to repay $2 billion in debt that is coming due on 19 December. In the event of non-payment, the country will find itself an outcast of the international financial community. 
	
	
 The IMF administrators' bookkeeping-based decision marks a toughening of its policy, which America's republicans, who are especially critical of the Fund's past largesse, have called for over the past years. The first illustration of a change in the position of the United States (the Fund's leading shareholder) toward countries that may squander the American taxpayer's money was the arrival in September of Ann Krueger, an ultraliberal American, as number two at the IMF. Moreover, the ""Argentine case"" falls at a bad time. President Bush now needs parliamentary votes to get more powers on trade negotiation matters and a green light on the economic stimulation plan that has been dragging along for the past two months. The president could not take any risk of ruffling the republicans. Furthermore, Argentina is not a priority for the Americans now, confides a member of the IMF. Also, the risk that its bankruptcy will cause a chain reaction and lead to a grave crisis among emerging nations is, according to economists, not very likely or at most limited. Brazil has had time to lessen its dependence on trade links with Argentina. The other emerging nations are calling on foreign capital less since the Asian crisis and a sharp ebb in investments would not have the dramatic impact that it had in 1997-1998. Will Argentina be declared bankrupt on 19 December? The fate of 30 million Argentines depends on this. Regardless of what happens, the current extremely perilous situation is another setback for the IMF. It has been following Argentina's national accounting with a magnifying glass for the past ten years and it has shown it is incapable of guaranteeing the country's financial equilibrium just as most of the countries that submit to its demands.

Beijing, December 20 (XINHUA) -- China believes that the Argentine government and people will overcome the current difficulties, revive their economy and maintain their social stability, said Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue here Thursday. 
	
	
 Zhang made the remarks at a regular press conference when asked to comment on the current situation in Argentina. 
	
	
 Zhang said recently some serious disturbances such as shop robberies and traffic breakdowns occurred in Argentina, and some groceries owned by overseas Chinese as well as Argentine citizens with Chinese origin were among those looted. 
	
	
 She added that the Argentine government has declared a 30-day emergency. 
	
	
 China is very concerned about this matter, and the Chinese Embassy in Argentina has asked the Argentine government to ensure the life and property safety of the overseas Chinese and Argentine citizens with Chinese origin, Zhang said.

 THE JOB MARKET AND THE DEMOGRAPHIC SITUATION 
	
	
 During October, 151,800 jobless citizens applied to the state employment services in search of work, which was 13,500 more people (9.8%) than had applied in September. The number of citizens with unemployed status decreased 14.4% over the past 12 months, including by 1.4% in the past month. This group totalled 971,200 persons at the beginning of November 
	
	
 The drop in the absolute number of unemployed led to a reduction in the registered unemployment rate from 4.2% on 1 November of last year to 3.5% of the able-bodied population of working age on the same date of the current year. 
	
	
 An increase in the number of available jobs (vacancies), accompanied by a drop in the number of unemployed citizens during the past 12 months, has reduced the strain in the labor market. The load coefficient per job (vacancy) during the indicated period decreased from 15 to nine persons as of 1 November 2001. In October 2001, the employment services helped to find jobs for 83,000 persons. This placement rate exceeded the volume of job placements during the corresponding month in 2000 by one-third (32.5%) and by 9% the rate in September of the current year. 
	
	
 During October, the state employment service removed 83,400 persons from its register for a number of reasons (including the fact that some people had found jobs on their own). This number exceeded by 0.5% the number of job placements. In addition, early retirement was granted to 2,700 persons. 
	
	
 During October 2001, Hr48.9 million were spent from the universally compulsory State Social Unemployment Insurance Fund to provide assistance to the unemployed. The average recorded number of unemployed who received unemployment benefits in October 2001 totalled 589,800 persons. 
	
	
 On 1 November 2001, the estimated size of the population of Ukraine was 49 million. During January-September of the current year, the total number of inhabitants of Ukraine decreased by nearly 324,000 persons. The decline in the size of the population is occuring due both to a natural decrease (287,000 persons) and to emigration (37,000). However, compared with the same period last year, the volume of natural decrease of population fell 7.2%. The birthrate measures 7.7 per 1,000 inhabitants as against 7.8 per 1,000 in January-October of last year. At the same time the death rate has dropped from 15.3 to 14.7 per 1,000.

 Noting that the agreements signed in 1960 for Cyprus were considered as nonexistent by many countries, Denktas said that the international society treated the island as if it was a Greek Cypriot Republic and treated its Turkish partner as if it was a minority. 
	
	
 Denktas said that they are ready to live together with Greek Cypriots in the island, adding that they don`t have the will to send Greek Cypriots from the island. 
	
	
 ``We wish them to give up their wish and policy to throw us from the island. They should not condemn us with lies and by deceiving the world,`` he said. 
	
	
 Denktas noted that there is no Cypriot nation in the island and there can`t be a minority if there is no nation, stressing that he will launch efforts to make Cyprus a friendship bridge between Turkey and Greece. 
	
	
 Calling on the representatives of the Turkish world who attended the congress, Denktas said that Turkish Cypriots are not minority in the island and representatives should explain this fact in every place which they visit. 
	
	
 Also asking for help from the Turkish press, Denktas said that ``I ask for help from the press as I will negotiate for peace and compromise to solve Cyprus question. I would like these representatives to explain the fact to the EU, which forgot the 1960 Constitution that the Turkish Cypriots are not minority and the Greek Cypriot side which wants to join the EU unilaterally and as if it was the legitimate government of Cyprus is not expected in the EU.`` 
	
	
 Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, TRNC, autonomous federal states namely Altay, Bashkortostan, Chuvashia, Khakassia, Gagauz Place, Chechnia, Crimea, Saha, Tatarstan, Tuva, and Turks living in Romania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Kosovo, Western Thrace, the U.S., Europe, Middle East and Afghanistan attended the meeting which was held under the auspices of former Turkish President Suleyman Demirel.

ANKARA (A.A) - 21.12.2001 - Yasin Hatiboglu, Deputy Chairman of the SP [Felicity Party]'s Parliamentary Group, claiming that countries in which the programs of the IMF [International Monetary Fund] are implemented experience the same fate, has said that the government must see the social explosion that has occurred in Argentina. 
	
	
 Hatiboglu began a press conference he held at the TBMM [Turkish Grand National Assembly] by saying that ""I hope that Mr. [State Minister for the Economy Kemal] Dervis will not have the same fate as [former Argentine Economics Minister Domingo] Cavallo, and that our country's fate will not be the same as Argentina's."" 
	
	
 Claiming that Indonesia, Malaysia, and Argentina, in which IMF programs were implemented, have all suffered the same fate, Hatiboglu called for taking lessons from the developments in Argentina. Hatiboglu spoke as follows: 
	
	
 ""This government must finally see the Argentine government, and the social explosion that has befallen Argentina. Yesterday, Argentina as well was being portrayed as if everything there were going fine. It was said that Argentina was having success. Well, until the IMF brought them to the point of death, just as there's a transitory motion that's seen in corpses, that's what happened in Argentina."" 
	
	
 Noting that a temporary golden age had been experienced in Argentina, Hatiboglu said that ""The IMF knows very well how to calculate just when it will deliver the actual death blow. It delivered that blow, and hit Argentina. What you're calling the IMF is the ideal of a world kingdom."" 
	
	
 Those who use the IMF 
	
	
 Hatiboglu, explaining that the IMF is in the hands of the ""forces of money"", said that these latter ""toy with"" the world in palms of their hands. 
	
	
 Hatiboglu responded as follows to a journalist's question as to whether Argentina had intentionally been brought to its current situation: 
	
	
 ""There's a fantasy of a world kingdom that utilizes the IMF. Those who are really behind it all, those who are behind this business, use the IMF. Just as Kemal Dervis is a means in our country, and if through him they are able to orient Turkey in any way they choose, they are able to do whatever they want with countries by means of the IMF."" 
	
	
 Criticism of government 
	
	
 Claiming that the family structure and social solidarity in Turkey are different from those in Argentina, Hatiboglu charged that, by means of the new Family Law, efforts are underway to do away with these. 
	
	
 Criticizing the policies of the government, Hatiboglu spoke as follows: ""With such a Prime Minister, this country cannot be brought to prosperity; it will just be dragged along. With these three musketeers [a reference to the three-party coalition government], this country can only be dragged along, but won't get anywhere."" 
	
	
 Yasin Hatiboglu also criticized the implementation of the program wherein classical Turkish 'divan' literature will not be taught in schools, and that, instead, pre-Republic and post-Republic literature will be taught. Stating that he intended to bring the matter onto the agenda through the Parliamentary oversight mechanisms, Hatiboglu said that ""No one has the right to wage war against the history of this nation."" 
	
	
 Criticizing as well the appointment of Kemal Alemdaroglu as rector of Istanbul University, Hatiboglu noted that the failure to discuss the report by the Higher Education Research Commission had been instrumental in this, and charged that President Ahmet Necdet Sezer had appointed Alemdaroglu even though aware of the allegations concerning him. 
	
	
 Responding to a question, Yasin Hatiboglu asserted that the [controversial] 2002 calendar had not been prepared by the SP itself, but rather that the calendar that has made news had in fact been composed by a private firm.

A cargo ship intercepted in the Channel after a tip-off that it might be carrying terrorist materials was today given the all clear, police said. 
	
	
 The 450ft long vessel Nisha, carrying 26,000 tonnes [metric tons] of raw sugar, was stopped on Friday morning [21 December] amid fears it could be transporting noxious, hazardous or dangerous substances. 
	
	
 But after a detailed examination of the ship, which is currently moored off the Isle of Wight, nothing suspicious was found, police said. 
	
	
 Assistant Commissioner David Veness, head of Scotland Yard's specialist operations, said: ""New information, combined with the relentless efforts of scientific experts, our detailed knowledge of the ship and its movements, and very careful examination of the vessel over the last three days leads us to be completely satisfied that the Nisha is not a suspicious vessel and does not pose a danger."" 
	
	
 The Nisha was halted by anti-terrorist police, the Royal Navy and Customs and Excise officials after a tip-off that it contained ""terrorist material"" and the Royal Navy frigate HMS Sutherland intercepted her in international waters, about 30 miles south of Beachy Head. 
	
	
 The MV Nisha is operated by the Great Eastern Shipping Company, based in Bombay, India. 
	
	
 It had recently stopped in the east African country of Djibouti, a neighbour of Somalia, which has been linked to Usama Bin Ladin's al Qa'ida terror network. 
	
	
 The ship had sailed from Mauritius and was carrying a cargo of sugar to the Tate &amp;amp; Lyle refinery on the Thames at Silvertown in east London, according to the company. 
	
	
 Police had earlier indicated they expected the search to take a number of weeks, because of the vessel's size and design, but experts completed the job today. 
	
	
 Anti-terrorist officers said they were also satisfied that the ship's crew and owners had not committed any offence. 
	
	
 Mr Veness said the ship was now in a position to continue its journey, but completion of the voyage was still subject to consultation with all interested parties. 
	
	
 He added: ""We have not detected any signs of interference and we do not believe that the seals of the holds have been interfered with. 
	
	
 ""We had anticipated that detailed examination of the ship might take rather longer. This was to ensure that there was no chance of risk to the public. 
	
	
 ""The cargo ship Nisha was intercepted and boarded as part of an intelligence-led operation. 
	
	
 ""This was the right and proper course of action to take. Thankfully, the ship has been proved not to pose a danger to the public."" 
	
	
 Mr Veness praised the crew and ship's owners for their co-operation and said: ""We remain vigilant and are totally committed to ensuring the safety of the public. 
	
	
 ""We would take similar action in the future if there was a potential risk to the public."" 
	
	
 The Nisha's cargo of raw sugar is owned by the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate, which had chartered the vessel, and the vessel was due to dock in east London yesterday. 
	
	
 The chairman of the British arm of the Great Eastern Shipping Company, Sudhir Mulji, confirmed that the vessel had stopped over at Djibouti before its current journey to drop off American grain as part of a food aid shipment. 
	
	
 The ship then went on to Mauritius to pick up the sugar and left on November 20 to transport it to Britain. 
	
	
 The Great Eastern Shipping Company, which has offices in India, London, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, is a leading Indian shipping and offshore service provider with a fleet of 38 cargo-carrying vessels.

 Tokyo, Dec. 26 (Yonhap) -- Japanese defense authorities have confirmed that the vessel initially suspected of being a North Korean spy ship communicated with the North before being intercepted and sunk by Japanese patrol boats after an exchange of fire in the East China Sea Saturday, Japan's Sankei Shimbun said in its Wednesday edition. The authorities were able to confirm via information provided by the U.S. military that the trawler exchanged messages with the North before it was intercepted by patrol boats off the Japanese island of Amami Oshima. The U.S. forces stationed in Japan provided video information of the vessel after detecting it via a military reconnaissance satellite on Dec. 18. The following day, Japanese defense officials were able to determine that the trawler was using the North Korean Workers' Party radio frequency. An antisubmarine patrol aircraft was dispatched to the scene and located the vessel Saturday, three days after the authorities had received the information from the United States. Although the defense officials declined to give details of the messages exchanged between the vessel and the North Korean side, they said, ""The ship may have been involved with the smuggling of drugs used to treat drug addicts."" The newspaper added that the Japanese government, which first believed the vessel was a North Korean spy ship based on its shape and equipment, have gained more evidence to support their suspicions. yct9423@yna.co.kr

President Hugo Chavez has warned that certain sectors have once again taken up the idea of looking forceful way out in Venezuela, either through a coup or an attack that would end his life. He added that for that purpose they are seeking someone in the FAN [National Armed Forces] who could assume power in Venezuela. 
	
	
 ""Since they have realized that this train is not stopping and that they are not going to stop it or run it off the track, ideas about destabilization have once again surfaced. Once again, ideas that Chavez has to be killed, that four shots would solve the problem, have emerged. It is a futile illusion because it is a lie. Even if such a thing were to happen, it would not solve the problem,"" the president said during his year-end message to the Vargas and Caracas garrisons, speaking from the Caracas Poliedro. 
	
	
 Chavez added that ""they are going around looking for a Pinochet, analyzing man by man to see who could be the Pinochet that they could pit against Chavez, and I am sure that there is no Pinochet in the FAN. I would venture to assure you that,"" he said. 
	
	
 The president charged that attacks targeting his person have gone on for over 10 years, and that he has been accused, among other things, of ties with the guerrillas, of buying arms and trying to set up a communist regime in Venezuela. He added that he would not find it at all strange if, at some time or other, they even managed to connect him with the terrorist Usama Bin Ladin, because he is sure that his opponents will use any strategy to try to discredit him. 
	
	
 Chavez said that more efforts would be made in 2002 to get the country moving ahead since he believes that it will be quite difficult politically, economically and socially. He noted that as the year draws to a close, the indicators are positive for Venezuela, then emphasized that the country has regained such internationally recognized posts as the presidency of the Group of the 15 and the Group of the 77. 
	
	
 The president complained about the mass media, accusing them of reporting whatever suits them. He pointed out that his annoyance does not extend to the journalists, but is directed at the owners of newspapers and radio and television broadcasting stations. 
	
	
 As for Argentina's decision not to pay its debt, the president said the measure would give the economy and people some breathing room. He wished the new Argentine Government good luck and is confident that it will get the country moving forward. 
	
	
 Chavez recalled that only a few years ago, Argentina was depicted as the model to follow. Now, however, the situation has reversed negatively as a result of the neoliberal policy to which he is opposed. He said that Venezuela was led away from that path because the same thing would have happened here. 
	
	
 The chief of state also recalled that the previous governments viewed the Colombian guerrillas as enemies of Venezuela, which led to operations in Colombian territory to attack the rebel groups. In his opinion, this was a serious error that resulted in victims and loss of Venezuelan lives because we were meddling directly in an internal conflict in Colombia."" [quotation marks as published] 
	
	
 ""We were meddling in an internal conflict of another country, which is a violation of international law and which in turn gave the guerrillas the right to attack our military units.""

Poll shows more Ukrainians against US campaign in Afghanistan 
	
	
 Text of report in English by Russian news agency Interfax 
	
	
 Kyiv, 29 December: Forty-three per cent of Ukrainians disapprove of the antiterrorist operation being carried out by the US in Afghanistan, according to a poll of 1,000 Ukrainian citizens conducted by GfK-USM at the request of the Institute of Politics between 25 and November and 5 December. At the same time, over a third - 34 per cent - support America's military campaign. ""Afghanistan is a historic memory for a whole generation of our compatriots and that is why they fear being drawn into the conflict. This should be a message for the authorities as concerns the stand the country has taken on this issue,"" Director of the Institute of Politics Mykola Tomenko told a press conference in Kyiv today. The lower the living standards of those polled, the less frequently they spoke in support of the US campaign, Tomenko said. For instance, 29 per cent of those who consider themselves ""poor"" support America and 46 per cent do not, while among those with ""high"" and ""average"" income levels 39 per cent approve of US policy and 45 per cent disapprove.

The Europeans are enthusiastically holding in their hands ""the euro, our currency"" that for so long had been no more than a much-wielded slogan. So is it really the moment to take a look at Argentina? More than ever in fact, as the financial crisis that is shaking Buenos Aires has a useful message for us: The choice of a currency can never be reduced to a simple act of political will. One must understand all the implications, often unfortunately invisible. 
	
	
 It is not enough to proclaim, even in the Constitution, that one peso is worth one dollar, for that to be really the case. The Argentines thought they had discovered the philosopher's stone in 1991. The linking to the dollar, as a guarantee of stability, was meant to rid them of the hyperinflation running at 2000 percent a year they had experienced during the 1970s and 80s. The tale today is all the more bitter as it began with such euphoria. 
	
	
 The social contract implemented by Carlos Menem at the start of his 10-year presidency (1989-99) was simple in principle and based on two pillars: Monetary discipline and liberalism. 
	
	
 Introducing the currency board system in 1991 obliged the central bank to guarantee the pesos in circulation with foreign currency reserves, in the same way as issuing bodies used to only issue notes to the equivalent of the gold reserves they held. Hence the official parity between the peso and the dollar until 1 December 2001 when it became necessary to introduce exchange controls with a devastating effect. 
	
	
 The commitment to liberalism, the second strand of the Menem program, lived up to its promises. Privatization earned $40 billion. Its success established the reputation of Buenos Aires on international markets. The real gauge of this confidence was the size of the national debt, that grew and grew. It more than doubled during the 1990s, from $60 billion to $132 or even $150 in 2001, making Argentina the number one market borrower among the emerging economies. 
	
	
 Looking back one can see a general lack of vigilance. Also on the part of the International Monetary Fund whose principal role is to be watchdog before bailing out those who come unstuck. Michael Mussa, chief economist with the IMF until last April, recognizes this: ""If we had paid more attention to the growing budgetary deficit and national debt between 1996 and 1998, Argentina would have been in a much better position to absorb the impact of the devaluation of the Brazilian real."" 
	
	
 The fall came in 1998, when Brazil, made vulnerable by the Asian crisis, abandoned its fixed parity against the dollar. Economists and market players then noticed that Argentina had been ""over-financed."" ""Credibility evaporated,"" to quote the expression of one expert who stresses the paradoxes of a system whose bases seemed sound. 
	
	
 First paradox: The Argentine economy is not very open, not even to its neighbors in Latin America. Its exports amount to just 8 percent of its GDP, as do its imports. The result is a trade balance, in marked contrast to a balance of payments deficit burdened by servicing its debt. Other countries live on a currency board system, most notably Hong Kong. But this Chinese territory has an extremely open economy, to the point where its exports exceed its GDP, thereby facilitating the influx of foreign currency. 
	
	
 Second paradox: The self-proclaimed parity between the peso and the dollar never enabled the government and even less private borrowers to obtain credit terms to match those enjoyed by the Americans. The risk premium has always been considerable, rates never falling below 10 percent. This places an unbearable burden on the government in servicing the debt and a revenue to match for the creditors. Argentine pension funds have enjoyed interest rates as high as 35 percent over recent months: No less than 45 percent of the national debt estimated at between $130 and $150 billion is held by the Argentines themselves. 
	
	
 Over recent weeks street demonstrations culminating in the general strike of 13 December have been the most visible aspect of a civil war between creditors and debtors. 
	
	
 Appeals were already made to the creditors during the first phase of the debt rescheduling involving the $55 billion held by Argentine funds and that was completed at the end of November. And they will come under pressure again: The IMF's recent refusal to approve a $1.3 billion loan is designed specifically to help Finance Minister Domingo Cavallo put pressure on private investors, as the latter have clearly understood even if not always the observers. At the same time private debtors who became indebted in a strong currency would find themselves ruined by a peso devaluation. This is why dollarization has generated such support among politicians: From former President Carlos Menem, today leader of the most influential Peronist faction, to new Finance Secretary Miguel Kiguel, a former banker, charged along with Domingo Cavallo with restoring order to public finances. 
	
	
 The final switch to the dollar would stabilize relations between creditors and debtors. But it would also be a very painful way of restoring credibility, ""like when one loses one's virginity and the only solution is to enter a convent,"" as one monetary expert put it. But neither dollarization nor the currency board provides a guarantee of low interest rates, as there will always be an ""Argentine risk."" Plus there is the problem of external competitiveness that remains unsolved. Unless the peso is devalued before it disappears, that is technically possible but more delicate when it comes to credibility. 
	
	
 That leaves the most economically realistic solution, the one backed by the technical experts: Floating the currency, but it is also the most risky. Are the Argentines now in a position to forge a new social contract?

The Argentine TV station Todo Noticias [""All News""] reported yesterday that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso on Saturday night telephoned Cordoba Province Governor Jose Manuel de la Sota, of the Justicialist Party (PJ) -- who once served as ambassador to Brazil -- to voice his concern over incidents in the country. 
	
	
 ""Cardoso told De la Sota that the images of the protests at the Plaza de Mayo show a country on the verge of a civil war,"" one of the channel's journalists commented. 
	
	
 According to the reporter, the Brazilian president apparently advised De la Sota to move forward the elections, initially slated for March 2002. But neither Itamaraty nor the Planalto Palace confirmed the president's phone call to the governor of Cordoba. 
	
	
 Legislators Request Action from the Brazilian Government 
	
	
 Concern has spread to Brazilian legislators. Violent attacks at the Argentine legislature sounded alarm bells in the Brazilian political arena, to the point that senators of the official and opposition parties defended more concrete support from the Brazilian Government for Argentina. Deputy Jose Genoino (Workers Party -- Sao Paulo) said that the wave of looting threatens Argentine democracy. He asked that Brazil promote meetings in the South American continent, or serve as intermediary in negotiations with international institutions. 
	
	
 ""This is an unpredictable, anarchical situation. We don't know where it will go, against whom. It is dangerous! In addition to Argentina there are other countries in crisis, such as Colombia and Venezuela. We have a very risky scenario. Any step backward for democracy on the continent would be a disaster. Brazil cannot stand by with its hands folded just watching all of this,"" Genoino affirmed. 
	
	
 PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] President Jose Anibal (Sao Paulo) said that Cardoso has already placed himself at the disposal of the Argentine Government to talk to international financial institutions. He noted, ""Brazil should adopt an open posture with relation to Argentina, which is experiencing a tragedy."" 
	
	
 For Jose Agripino Maia, PFL [Liberal Front Party] leader in the Senate, although Brazil has detached itself from Argentina, it should not disregard the message of the crises that is devastating the neighboring country. 
	
	
 ""The political warning must be heeded. Either one pays attention to the will of the people or what happened will happen."" Maia commented. 
	
	
 Senator Heloisa Helena (Workers Party -- Alagoas) said that Latin American countries should always join together to speak with international economic institutions, in order to maintain autonomy in their economies: ""Now we see what happens when one country abdicates its financial autonomy. I hope that this can alert the Brazilian Government to revise its relationship with the IMF."" 
	
	
 Analysts: Lack of Alternative for Power 
	
	
 Political scientists agree: Argentina lacks a political force that can stand up to Peronism and Radicalism. This is viewed as the main impediment to the establishment of political order in the country. USP [University of Sao Paulo] professor Emir Sader believes that Peronists will remain in power after the elections, slowly growing weaker, allowing room for the emergence of new leadership. 
	
	
 ""The degree of pauperization will be brutal. Everything depends on how long it takes for Peronism to burn out and new leadership to emerge,"" Sader said. 
	
	
 For the political scientist, Argentina cannot wait for assistance from the American Government. Latin America is no longer important because the focus now is on global security and no longer on the international economic order. 
	
	
 Sader affirmed, ""The new policy of (US President George W.) Bush is to permit decay. The concern now is security. All eyes are on Pakistan, China, and Russia.""

US envoy retired General Anthony Zinni is to arrive in the region under circumstances similar to those that surrounded his first visit to Palestine and Israel. The Israeli Government works to abort his mission in advance by storming Palestinian territories, assassinating citizens it alleges have links to security activities, and arresting innocent citizens. The only change is that the Israeli authorities have denied any link between a number of Palestinian martyrs and prisoners on one hand and the armed organizations on the other, saying they were mere unarmed citizens, who were accidentally present near regular Israeli targets. 
	
	
 Palestinians, during Zinni's presence in the region, abided by calm and cease-fire and are doing the same now. Meanwhile, Israel provokes Palestinians to draw vindictive reactions in order to win the world community's sympathy, particularly that of the United States, using the international anti-terror war and branding as terrorism any legitimate Palestinian conduct to get rid of occupation and settlements. For that purpose, Israel likens such reactions to what occured in the United States on 11 September. The world community, however, believes that in their struggle for liberation and independence, Palestinians seek negotiations for a peaceful settlement as a strategic option and a legitimate rejection of Israel's colonialism, imposed on the Palestinian people by force for more than 34 years now. 
	
	
 Israel's provocation is too harsh to be tolerated. The Israeli Government says it should have a free hand to storm the Palestinian areas; assassinate or arrest Palestinian citizens; demolish homes, headquarters, and establishments; uproot thousands of trees; and besiege cities and villages as it likes. While committing themselves to peace, Palestinians bear this patiently and suppress fury, hoping that the US-dominated world community will acknowledge that Palestinians seek calm and a just peace in order to end occupation and settlement in their territories and to enjoy freedom, dignity, and independence, like other world nations. 
	
	
 Past weeks' Incidents, President Arafat's cease-fire declaration, the anti-violence campaign, the other activities that Israel brands terrorism, and Israel's unjustified escalation show that Palestinians are totally committed to the peace process and the previous agreements and understandings. This is because the Palestinians have the goal of peace in mind, while the Israeli Government does its utmost to hamper the peace process, entrench occupation, and step up settlement building. US envoy Zinni is supposed to have realized these clear-cut facts through his reading of the latest developments in the region.

France's Chirac says Argentina must make necessary choices 
	
	
 Text of report by French news agency AFP 
	
	
 Paris, 2 January: During a telephone conversation on Wednesday [2 January] with the director general of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Horst Koehler, President Jacques Chirac stressed the need for Argentina to be able to ""make the choices"" imposed on it by the crisis it is going through. Reporting on the conversation, Elysee [presidency] spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said that the head of state had ""expressed the hope that the Argentine authorities will know how to make the choices needed for their country's future"". ""France, like its partners, is in contact with international financial institutions,"" the president said, ""and is ready to support the action of the IMF with a view to attaining a solution to this crisis."" Jacques Chirac, Mrs Colonna said, also raised with the IMF director general ""the situation of a number of other countries, among them Lebanon in connection with the consolidation of economic reforms in this country, with which France has special ties""!

Taipei, Jan. 3 (CNA) -- Premier Chang Chun-hsiung expressed alarm Thursday at reports that a legislator was kidnapped and held for three days in a Taipei hotel, saying that his government will do its utmost to stop gangsters from preying on lawmakers. 
	
	
 Presiding over an inter-agency conference on social order, Chang asked the police to catch the gangsters who allegedly detained Legislator Huang Hsien-chou at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Taipei. 
	
	
 Later that day, a man was arrested in Taipei in relation to the case. Chang Fu-shun, 27, is said to be the younger brother of Chang Hui-hua, who allegedly invited Huang to meet her at the hotel and who Huang claimed was in the hotel room when he was detained. 
	
	
 Huang claimed the previous day in Taichung that he had been trapped by the gangsters, who had pretended to be his political supporters. 
	
	
 Huang told reporters that the gangsters, who included at least two men and a woman, made an appointment to meet him at the hotel Dec. 26. When he arrived, he claimed, one of them offered him a drink and he lost consciousness after drinking it. 
	
	
 When he awoke, he found that his hands and feet had been bound. The gangsters demanded NT$2 million from him but finally settled for NT$800,000 which they withdrew using Huang's credit card. 
	
	
 Huang was released Dec. 31 and reported to police that day. 
	
	
 Huang revealed what he claimed to be the whole story at a news conference Wednesday night after press reports said he had in fact been caught with prostitutes in the hotel and blackmailed. 
	
	
 The police said that the hotel room had been paid for by a woman who checked in under the name of Lin An, which they said was an alias used by Chang Hui-hua.

US President Bush has ordered the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to assassinate America's opponents wherever in the world they may be! 
	
	
 This directive is issued at a time when the American government is claiming to lead the fight against terrorism throughout the world. 
	
	
 When the Imam (may God be satisfied with him) issued the fatwa against Salman Rushdie for insulting the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the holy Koran, the countries that are so-called supporters of human rights protested against the fatwa. They said it was an act of terrorism that was against international law and said it crushed human rights principles! In a coordinated move the European countries all recalled their ambassadors from Tehran in order to put the Islamic Republic of Iran under pressure. 
	
	
 By clarifying the Imam's edict the Islamic Republic of Iran made the people of the world understand that insulting the Prophet was in fact violating the rights of millions of people throughout the world. This was not simply a directive from God that was confirmed by all the clerics throughout the Islamic world. 
	
	
 Now the United States has issued an assassination order against millions of human beings without having any proof, reason or documentation. The only reason for this would be opposition to the United States. It would therefore be appropriate for all Islamic countries to withdraw their ambassadors from the United States. If the European countries were honest in the withdrawal of their ambassadors from Iran, blaming Iran for violating human rights, then they should recall their ambassadors from the United States. After all the United States is not violating the rights of one human being, but many many human beings. 
	
	
 It seems that following the blow that the Americans received on September 11 in New York and Washington, the United States is determined to take justice to pre-historic times. It is obvious no country will put up with this cruelty. No one will allow this human achievement, which is the discovery of God-given human rights, which is achieved after thousands of years of research, to be wasted away. 
	
	
 The United States thinks that it can silence the justice-seeking cries of the peoples of the world with the sound of explosions from 7-ton bombs and it thinks that it can justify its own inhuman behavior in the shadow of this noise. Attachments: Image-1.gif Image-2.gif

OVER 2,374 Bayelsa State people have received free medical services for various ailments, courtesy of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). 
	
	
 A breakdown of the statistics of patients that benefited from the exercise showed that 106 received general surgeries, 20 had eye cataract operations, 260 got eye glasses, while 1, 988 others had general consultations. 
	
	
 Apart from Odi whose people topped the number of beneficiaries (they got 1, 733 out of 2, 374 persons treated), other councils which participated in the free health care are Kolokuma/Opukoma, 284 persons, Kaiama, 213 persons, among others. 
	
	
 Co-ordinator of the project, Mr Sean Nortman, told reporters that 52 volunteers from various fields in medicine help to make the project a reality. 
	
	
 ""With the combined goal of providing free quality health care in this rural areas through the dispensing of prescribed drugs as well as undertaking surgeries that came to the medical site daily, we made it to give the patients we come in contact with health advice and education, hopefully to prevent further problems in the future,"" Nortman said. 
	
	
 In an interview with journalists later, NDDC Executive Director, Finance and Administration, Mr. Timi Alaibe, said that the choice of Odi was a deliberate policy to give the people of the area who are still recovering from the trauma of the 1999 sad incident a sense of belonging. 
	
	
 Alaibe said that the commission was genuinely determined to change the tide of things in Bayelsa and other NDDC states who have been long neglected over years.

A container from the Swedish nuclear technology firm Studsvik has leaked radioactive materials. The Swedish and US authorities are looking for people who might have been exposed to dangerous radiation, but there is no indication that the container started to leak in Sweden. This is Sweden's most serious incident so far involving radiation. 
	
	
 According to all indications, the radioactive container sent from the nuclear technology firm Studsvik to the US did not leak during transport within Sweden. When the container was transshipped in Paris, measurements showed no abnormal levels, according to the US Transport Department. 
	
	
 The container with the radioactive substance iridium 192 was transshipped at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris by the shipping company Federal Express. The pilot who was supposed to fly the container to the US was equipped with a dosimeter, which measures radiation levels. 
	
	
 The US Transport Department has now informed Studsvik that the measurements done by Federal Express in Paris showed no abnormality. This means that no leak occurred before the container left Paris. ""It this information is correct, it means that fewer people will have been exposed to radiation,"" said Hans-Bertil Hakansson, Studsvik managing director and concern chief, to DN [Dagens Nyheter]. 
	
	
 It is still not clear where the iridium container began to leak. ""However, it is extremely unlikely that the leak occurred during the flight from Paris to Memphis,"" Hakansson said. Studsvik expects to get confirmation of the information it has received today. ""But as we received it from a US official, we believe it is reliable,"" Hakansson said. 
	
	
 The iridium container left Studsvik in Nykoping on 27 December and was shipped via Norrkoping, Arlanda, and Paris to Memphis. On arrival, measurements showed that it was emitting far too much radiation. Measurements done at Studsvik before dispatch had not shown high radiation values. 
	
	
 Yesterday [07 January], the National Institute of Radiation Protection (SSI) announced that it could not exclude the possibility of people who had come into contact with the container suffering acute health effects from radiation. The event is classified as a level-three incident on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES), and is the most serious ever in Sweden. 
	
	
 The SSI is now attempting to trace people who could have been exposed to the radiation leak. The SSI says that this involves about ten people in Sweden. The iridium container will be examined in New Orleans by US authorities and Studsvik's own personnel within the next few weeks. ""When we open it, the whole picture will be cleared up,"" Hakansson said. 
	
	
 All shipments from Studsvik Isotope Service have been halted until further notice.

STAVROPOL. Jan 8 (Interfax-AVN) - Two citizens of Iraq were detained on the Russian border on Monday when they attempted to cross into the country illegally from Azerbaijan, a spokesman for the North Caucasus regional border guard department told Interfax- Military News Agency. The two detainees aged 26 were taken to a picket of the Derbent border guard detachment for a probe into the incident. Servicemen of the Sochi border guard department protecting a section of the Russian-Georgian frontier apprehended another violator on Monday, the spokesman said. A 33-year-old citizen of Romania tried to enter Russia illegally from Georgia's breakaway region of Abkhazia. According to the spokesman, heavy snowfalls and the risk of avalanches still limit the traffic on the Caucasus highway and Military Georgian highway. The Nizhny Zaramag checkpoint on the Russian-Georgian border is closed temporarily. The Verkhny Lars checkpoint is operating, but the number of people using it is very small. As many as 117 people and 58 vehicles crossed the border through that checkpoint on Monday, the spokesman said. @ 2002 Interfax-Military News Agency, All rights reserved.

Brussels -- This week, the Second Chamber will initiate the debate on euthanasia. It will discuss the bills on euthanasia and palliative care that the Senate approved in the autumn of 2001. 
	
	
 Ever since then, the Senate's work has been subject to increasing criticisms, including from groups that support a possible law on euthanasia. The criticisms mainly focus on the applicability of the Senate's bill, the lack of a palliative filter prior to committing euthanasia, the supervisory role of the assessment committee, which is likely to be understaffed, and the nonexistence of fixed penalties for unjustifiable cases of euthanasia. 
	
	
 The Chamber will treat the bill differently than the Senate, which worked with a joint justice and public health committee. The Chamber's health, environment, and social emancipation committee will only have an advisory role. Yesterday [8 January], this committee initiated a hearing on palliative care. It includes a few VLD [Flemish Liberal Democrats] deputies who are very critical of the senators' work. According to the CD&amp;amp;V [Christian Democratic and Flemish], this is why this committee has only been given an advisory function. 
	
	
 Moreover, the Chamber's justice committee seems to want to go it alone regarding the euthanasia debate. This committee is scheduled to start the debate on the Senate's euthanasia bill today. 
	
	
 However, SP.A [Dutch-speaking Socialist Party - Different] Deputy Fred Erdman has drafted his own bill ""regarding the problems connected with terminating one's life and the condition of terminally ill patients."" VLD Floor Leader Hugo Coveliers and party member Maggie De Block also have a bill on euthanasia. A resolution proposed by Yolande Avondroodt (VLD) requesting working out a ""palliative care plan according to a patient's needs"" is based on this bill. 
	
	
 The Chamber apparently wants to push ahead with the debate on euthanasia because available speaking time is very limited.

That Angela Merkel, the chairwoman of the Christian Democratic Union, wanted the job had long been an open secret, although no one but she knew how far she was prepared to go. But it was the uncertainty with which her rival, Bavarian Premier Edmund Stoiber of the Christian Social Union, the CDU's Bavarian sister party, also shrouded himself that made the question of who would lead the Union parties into the 22 September elections as chancellor candidate against incumbent Gerhard Schroeder, so exciting. Mr. Stoiber has come a long way from his refusal to sacrifice himself for the CDU in an election that once looked impossible to win, through his statement that he would under no circumstances run against the wishes of Ms. Merkel and her party, to his willingness to take her on in a divisive vote if necessary. 
	
	
 Mr. Stoiber carefully tread the path to the candidacy, spurred on by many and reined in by others. But he let slip the opportunities to turn back, because the forces that drive him -- his desire to affect change, his sense of duty to his peers and his ambition -- would not permit him to pass up the biggest chance of his political life. Mr. Stoiber seized it once the CDU made clear that it preferred him to its own chairwoman. That has always been the basic premise for a CSU chairman to accept the candidacy on behalf of the bigger sister party. It does not, of course, guarantee success at the polls -- or even solidarity in the campaign. 
	
	
 Certainly, Mr. Stoiber has done everything in his power to spare himself the fate of his mentor, Franz Josef Strauss. Rather than force himself on the CDU, he waited to be called. Having marginalized their own leader, the CDU grandees cannot afford to leave the chancellor candidate in the lurch as well. The most cogent argument in Mr. Stoiber's favor is that he will be running as a hopeful and not as the ticket of last resort. The CDU chose him because it believes in victory. The government is floundering, more seriously than anyone would have thought six months ago. The Union parties could not have wished for a better situation from which to launch their campaign. If anyone in their ranks can turn this to their advantage, it is Mr. Stoiber. 
	
	
 Nonetheless, he will be made to realize that he cannot command the CDU, that his power base lies in Munich and not in Berlin, and that the invitation of kingmakers to accept the crown comes at a cost. Nor will Mr. Stoiber have any illusions of what it means to lead an election campaign, although he can be confident in the knowledge that what is at stake is not Edmund Stoiber, nor the Union, but Germany as a whole.

The federal and local authorities are currently preparing the ratification of the Kyoto international protocol on limiting the emission of greenhouse gases. Within the framework of that protocol, Belgium must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 7.5 percent, compared to 1990, in the 2008-2012 period. Following the formal ratification of the Kyoto protocol by all the parliaments of the concerned countries, that protocol will become equivalent to a Belgian law. This implies -- whether or not one agrees with it -- that the Kyoto protocol will become binding for all of this country's inhabitants and institutions. 
	
	
 We readily accept that there are good intentions on the part of both the government and this country's various sectors to comply with the Kyoto standards. However, no broad social debate has yet been conducted on the crucial question: How much should each sector or target group contribute to achieving the Belgian Kyoto standard? Because this debate has failed to take place, it is understandable that all sectors (ranging from processing and manufacturing industrial sector, the electricity sector, the tertiary sector, and the transport sector to the residential sector) are currently doing their utmost to make their own future efforts as small (yet acceptable) as possible. 
	
	
 That is strikingly illustrated by Belgian large-scale industry, which has made great efforts over the past 10 years, over which energy intensity (energy use per unit of final product) has improved considerably. But a very considerable increase in production is expected in Belgium over the next 10 years, so that (even with very efficient processes) overall carbon dioxide emissions will certainly rise. Large-scale industry wishes to counter the expected rise with so-called benchmark covenants. 
	
	
 In a nutshell, benchmarking means that companies compare their energy efficiency with that of similar plants abroad. In these covenants, the companies pledge to rank among the world leaders in energy efficiency by 2012. In return for their commitment, they are exempted from additional (Flemish) emission restrictions, taxes on emissions, or negotiable emission rights. 
	
	
 Belgian industry is advocating benchmark covenants because it is afraid that an absolute limit would weaken considerably its competitive position with respect to similar companies in regions where the Kyoto protocol is not ratified. According to industry, relocation, with the resulting job losses, would be the only solution. However, this disregards the fact that arguments other than purely financial ones also play a part in the location decisions of companies in our region (favorable location near seaports, availability of know-how, well-educated personnel, stable political climate...). 
	
	
 Those covenants contain insufficient guarantees in themselves to achieve the Belgian/Flemish reduction targets in an economically efficient manner. 
	
	
 To begin with, the principle of benchmarking itself raises questions. If it were to emerge from the comparison with domestic and foreign companies that certain companies do not rank among the world leaders in energy efficiency, they would have to present a plan to achieve the highest energy efficiency on time (by 2012). But benchmarking is not sufficient from the viewpoint of economic efficiency (realizing the Kyoto restrictions on emissions at the lowest possible costs for the whole of society). 
	
	
 A cost-efficient division of efforts implies that each sector must limit its emissions to the point at which the additional costs for one extra ton of reduction are the same in all sectors. As a result, the costs of additional restrictions on emissions in industry must be compared with those of other sectors, such as the transport sector, households, the service sector, and so forth. Benchmarking guarantees only that companies belong to the top of their class, but says nothing about that class's performance as compared with the whole universe. 
	
	
 Second, benchmark covenants do not guarantee that the external climate costs of energy use (the increased greenhouse effect caused by the burning of fossil fuels) are correctly taken into account in the final products of the sectors concerned. However, taking into account these external climate costs is essential, because the users of energy-intensive goods are confronted in that way with the consequences of their choice of product. In that way, less energy-intensive products enjoy a relative advantage. 
	
	
 Third, questions can be asked about the emission restrictions that would be achieved by the covenants. Companies are urged in the proposed covenants to adopt measures which have an economic cost recovery period of less than five years or have an internal rate of return greater than that of a straight-lined obligation. But it is highly unclear whether these measures will lead to many extra reductions of emissions in comparison with the business as usual scenario without additional policy efforts. 
	
	
 Fourth is the contrast between the benchmark covenants' relative emissions standards and the Belgian Government's absolute restrictions on emissions within the framework of the Kyoto protocol. Since industry does not wish to let itself be pinned down on an absolute emissions ceiling, while the government feels itself committed to an absolute ceiling, industry is foisting the necessary efforts onto other sectors in society through the benchmark covenants. If industrial greenhouse gas emissions increase considerably over the next 10 years, that will have to be offset by a commensurate reduction of emissions in the transport sector, services, households, and so forth. 
	
	
 Thus the benchmark covenants could have very significant consequences for other sectors and target groups in our society, whereas the latter are not involved in the deliberations on those covenants. Hence a broad social debate on who should contribute how much to realizing the Kyoto standards is urgently necessary. 
	
	
 Despite these shortcomings, we believe that a role is reserved for the instrument of benchmark covenants. Thus the benchmark covenants could be reconciled with the European Commission's recent proposals for launching a unified market for European carbon dioxide emissions by 2005. This European proposal assumes absolute restrictions on emissions (companies obtain rights to emit a certain number of tons of carbon dioxide) and is hence irreconcilable at first sight with the Flemish benchmark covenants. However, the benchmark covenants could be opportune here for settling the initial allocation of emission rights. Companies could be allocated rights on the basis of an energy efficiency standard, on the condition that they are prepared to accept an absolute emissions ceiling. However, if they wish to emit more (because, for instance, their output is increasing considerably), they can do so provided that they purchase the necessary emission rights from companies which have a surplus of rights. 
	
	
 The great advantage of negotiable emission rights in that the system can lead to a cost-efficient division of effort among all sectors and target groups. By using the benchmark covenants to allocate emission rights initially, the good points of covenants are retained and their drawbacks are eliminated. 
	
	
 In any case, it is high time that a social debate be organized on the division of effort to achieve the Kyoto aims. Only a division that takes account of every sector's possibilities and is borne by the various target groups guarantees that Belgium will achieve its Kyoto aims without draconian measures having to be adopted at the eleventh hour.

Havana, January 12 (XINHUA) -- Cuba will not create obstacles to the U.S. decision to hold part of the Taliban and al-Qaeda war prisoners at the U.S. naval base of Guantanamo, the Cuban government said in a statement on Friday. 
	
	
 This is the first time that the Cuban government has expressed its position over the U.S. holding of the Taliban and al-Qaeda prisoners in its territory. 
	
	
 Guantanamo is part of the Cuban territory, but the Cuban government will not create obstacles to the U.S. transfer of the war prisoners there, it said. 
	
	
 The Guantanamo Bay has been in U.S. hands since the Spanish- American War in 1898. The United States has refused to give up the facility, which is sealed from Cuba by a heavily guarded, 27- kilometer perimeter fence, despite Cuban objection to its continued existence. 
	
	
 In the statement, the Cuban government said the country would maintain close contacts with the U.S. military personnel in the naval base. 
	
	
 A first group of 20 war prisoners from Afghanistan arrived Friday afternoon at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo on the southeastern tip of Cuba, about 1,000 kilometers from the capital city of Havana.

 Beijing, Jan. 12 (Yonhap) -- Criminals have been increasingly preying on Korean travellers and residents in China with the increase of exchanges between the two countries since the opening of diplomatic relations in 1992. Over the past three years, 15 Koreans were murdered, 177 were assaulted, 95 kidnapped or illegally confined, and 64 robbed, the Korean Embassy in Beijing said Saturday. The figures are feared to be higher since many cases were not reported, an embassy official said. The most frequent crimes involved the loss or theft of Korean passports, according to the official. Last year alone, 1,800 Korean passports were reported missing in China -- 1,000 in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, 400 in Beijing and 200 in Shanghai, the official said. Missing passports find their way to human traffickers, he said. 
	
	
 ""About 90 percent of foreigners' missing passports are Korean's, and the missing passports are being used mostly for crimes like illegal entry, downgrading the nation's credibility in the international community,"" the official said. The number of crimes committed by Koreans has also been on the increase. Among the crimes are illegal trafficking or forgery of passports, drug production and transportation, smuggling, overstaying visas and drunk driving, the official said. Last year, 1.6 million Koreans travelled to China, up from 1.34 million in 2000, and the number of Korean students in China hit 16,000, more than any other country; Japan trailed with 15,000 students, the official said. hsj@yna.co.kr

COTABATO CITY - An alleged member of Nur Misuari's elite force said Saturday there is a plan to rescue their jailed leader. 
	
	
 MacArthur Rasul, who claims to be a spokesperson of Misuari's Mutallah Force, said the group was just waiting for orders to mount the rescue operation. 
	
	
 Rasul told Radio Mindanao Network here that some 1,000 members of the Misuari force have been on standby and are prepared to spring their leader from detention in Sta. Rosa, Laguna, at anytime. 
	
	
 Misuari, charged with rebellion for the Nov. 19 mutiny staged in Jolo by his followers, is locked up at the Fort Sto. Domingo police detention facility in Sta. Rosa. His pocket rebellion and a subsequent hostage-taking situation resulted in over 100 deaths. 
	
	
 ""Our field commanders are just waiting for orders from the higher hierarchy,"" Rasul said. 
	
	
 Rasul admitted, however, that even if there was a strong desire among Misuari's followers to free him, the plan would fail if the jailed rebel leader went against it. 
	
	
 ""If Chairman Misuari would go against (the rescue), we cannot do otherwise (but follow) because he is our commander in chief,"" he said. 
	
	
 But while admitting to the plot, Rasul said Misuari's followers were also appealing to the Macapagal administration to free their leader. ""For the sake of peace,"" he said. 
	
	
 Rasul said they could not understand why the government was so hard on Misuari when it was lenient with other leaders who revolted in the past. 
	
	
 ""If the government was able to extend amnesty to our Christian brothers, like (former renegade Army officer Gregorio) ""Gringo"" Honasan and others, why can't it accord the same privilege to Chairman Misuari?"" Rasul asked. 
	
	
 Local Government Assistant Secretary Abraham Iribani called on Saturday for sobriety among Muslim leaders and Moro National Liberation Front commanders amid alleged attempts by certain groups to start a religious war over Misuari's detention. 
	
	
 ""We should remain calm and let the law take its course,"" Iribani, designated government spokesperson for Misuari's case, said he told a group of Muslim leaders and MNLF commanders in a dialogue in Zamboanga City. 
	
	
 Irabini said he explained to them that Misuari was being held for rebellion, and not because ""he was a Muslim, a member of the Bangsamoro people or an MNLF leader."" 
	
	
 Some Moro groups had claimed Misuari's detention was an affront to the Muslim people and should be cause for a ""Muslim war."" 
	
	
 ""I told them the act of rebellion happened in public and the charges were not just fabricated,"" Iribani said in a phone interview. 
	
	
 Dialogue 
	
	
 The local government official held a dialogue with the Muslim leaders to officially report to them Misuari's status and answer their questions about his arrest and detention. 
	
	
 Iribani also dismissed reports that renegade MNLF commanders were plotting to stage bomb attacks in Mindanao and Metro Manila to protest Misuari's arrest. 
	
	
 ""That's not true,"" he said. 
	
	
 Iribani said he explained to the Muslim leaders that Misuari's personal demands, including access to the media, could not be granted because these were not within his rights as a detainee. 
	
	
 As this developed, the number of lawyers who will defend Misuari grew to 28, after former Davao City Mayor Benjamin de Guzman and two others agreed to serve as his counsel. 
	
	
 De Guzman said it was lawyer Macapanton Abbas Jr. who asked him, former vice mayor Dominador Zuno Jr. and city councilor Victorio Advincula to join the team of lawyers that would defend Misuari in court. 
	
	
 Misuari's other lawyers warned yesterday the country's judicial system, more than their client, will be on trial because of the legal nuances surrounding his arrest. 
	
	
 The deportation of Misuari by Malaysia also drew flak from opposition legislators who warned that it could trigger a reaction in the government's peace efforts. 
	
	
 Maguindanao Rep. Didagen Dilangalen said the prosecution of Misuari for rebellion could force the government to revive the cases against other rebel leaders, particularly of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the National Democratic Front. 
	
	
 Sen. Aquilino Pimentel expressed the same apprehension. 
	
	
 Aside from the sensitive legal questions, Pimentel said there is a growing impression that Misuari could pose a security threat to the country. 
	
	
 Among the other members of Misuari's defense team are former Integrated Bar of the Philippines president Arthur Lim, former Court of Appeals justice Omar Amin, former labor relations commissioner Musib Buat, Salvador Panelo, US-based Elly Pamatong and former ARRM solicitor general Jose Lorena.

MOSCOW. Jan 14 (Interfax) - Russia stands for the quickest possible investigation of an incident late in December in which Israel seized a ship in the Red Sea loaded with weapons to be smuggled into the Palestinian self-ruled territory, a senior official said on Monday. ""It is necessary now to find out the truth about the ship which was carrying weapons to be smuggled, and punish those guilty,"" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Saltanov told Interfax. The ambiguity of the case is ""an obstacle to the resumption of efforts to launch the Tenet-Mitchell plan. It is in this key that we are conducting a dialogue with the Israeli and Palestinian leaders."" After Israel seized the ship, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon demanded the arrest of the Palestinian officials who, the Israelis claim, were behind the attempt to smuggle weapons into the Gaza Strip. He threatened to keep Yasser Arafat stranded in Ramallah, in the West Bank, until the Palestinian leader has fulfilled this and other conditions. ""If Arafat fails to fulfill them he will be there [in Ramallah] for as long as I remain prime minister,"" Sharon warned.

Lugano, 8 Jan -- Spanish-Israeli businessman Felipe Turover has denounced the Swiss in front of the European Human Rights Court in Strasbourg for having put his life in danger in its case against [Secretary of the Russian-Belarus Union] Pavel Borodin, former Kremlin senior aid accused of money laundering, according to a communique Tuesday from his lawyer Niccolo Salvioni. 
	
	
 According to the communique, received at the Swiss news agency ATS, the 37-year-old M. Turover --considered by the Swiss courts as a key witness -- had asked the Swiss Government and the Swiss Public Ministry that he be put under protection, believing himself threatened by the Russian Mafia because of leaks by Swiss court officials. 
	
	
 Pavel Borodin, the former property manager of the Kremlin, is suspected of having laundered some $25 million in secret commissions which came from two Swiss companies headquartered in the Tessin (southeast) region -- Mercata, and Mabetex -- in exchange for being awarded the contracts for the renovation of the Kremlin and the Russian presidential aircraft in 1995 and 1996. 
	
	
 At the end of June 2001, the Swiss Public Ministry rejected a complaint from Turover against a former Ministry official, Carla Del Ponte -- today a lawyer with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) -- in which Turover accused her of putting his life in danger during this case; in November the rejection was upheld by the Federal Tribunal, which is Switzerland's highest court. 
	
	
 Turover accused Mme. Del Ponte of having furnished -- in 1999 when she headed the Swiss Public Ministry -- confidential information to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera which made numerous revelations about the Mabetex-Borodin affair, including the existence of credit cards in the name of the Yeltsin family. The newspaper presented Turover as a key informer in this affair and the Spanish-Israeli businessman affirmed that these leaks had put his life in danger. 
	
	
 Today, Turover is accusing the Swiss authorities of having violated on several occasions the European Convention on Human Rights. The communique from his lawyer affirms that the Swiss authorities, the Federal Tribunal, and the Swiss Public Ministry ""have given proof of illegality and political persecution."" 
	
	
 Mabetex, a construction company, is suspected of having landed public contracts for renovating the Kremlin and other Russian official buildings by offering bribes worth a dozen million dollars in 1995 and 1996 to close associates of former Russian president Boris Yeltsin, including to Borodin. 
	
	
 At the request of the Geneva court, Borodin was arrested in the United States January 17, 2001. He agreed to be extradited to Switzerland April 7th. After six days in preventive detention, he was released on bail for $3 million.

The U.S. government says that the terrorist attack on New York City was an act of war. Yet it refuses to treat those it has captured in the course of this war as prisoners of war. Instead, it refers to them as ""unlawful combatants"" not entitled to the protection of the 1949 Geneva Convention, which the U.S. signed and which sets out rules for treating enemy soldiers. It shackles them, houses them in unprotected chain link compounds (in Cuba, of all places) and threatens ""intense interrogation."" 
	
	
 This may be convenient for Washington. But it sets a dangerous precedent for all soldiers who face capture in the so-called war on terrorism, including Canada's. 
	
	
 Perhaps it is perverse to have rules for warfare. But the world is a perverse place. And so, since the late 19th century, most nations that call themselves civilized have adhered to such rules. The 1949 Geneva Convention specifies that any belligerents captured in the course of war - be they regular soldiers, militia members or volunteers ""operating in or outside their territory even if this territory is occupied"" - must be accorded prisoner of war status. The convention exempts only those, such as spies and saboteurs, who do not clearly identify themselves as belligerents. But clearly it was meant to apply to the Taliban and Al Qa'ida fighters captured after vicious battles in Afghanistan, fighters who made no secret of who they were, what they were supporting and who they thought their enemies were. 
	
	
 But then, if they were dealt with properly, the U.S. would have less leeway. Under the Geneva Convention, prisoners of war must be treated humanely. Their captors are forbidden from inflicting ""outrages upon personal dignity"" or ""inhumane and degrading treatment."" Prisoners of war are not required to give their captors information beyond name, rank and serial number. Under the convention, they must ""be quartered under conditions as favourable as those for forces of the detaining power who are billeted in the same area."" 
	
	
 To be more precise, prisoners of war are not to be treated like those jailed by the U.S. at its Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba. Those detainees, brought shackled, shaved and blindfolded to Cuba, are kept in chain link pens under the constant glare, night and day, of halogen lamps. (The blindfolding, deliberate disorientation, discomfort and constant light are staples of police states all over the world. The idea is to break down the inmate, weaken him from lack of sleep and thereby make him more pliable when the interrogators begin their serious work). Washington is brazen about its flouting of international law, secure in the knowledge that neither its citizens not its allies will complain. Indeed, many Americans (and some Canadians) probably think anyone connected to the Sept. 11 terror attacks deserves whatever he gets. 
	
	
 There are, however, a couple of problems with this understandable, if knee-jerk, response. First, it assumes that those selected for Guantanamo are connected to the Sept. 11 attacks. Maybe some are (although the world would have a better idea if the U.S., in line with the Geneva Convention, specified just who it was holding). More likely though, the U.S. is using the broadest of brooms to sweep up detainees for Cuba. American intelligence agencies - doubly embarrassed by their failure to foresee the Sept. 11 attack and their inability to locate Usama Bin Ladin - are probably not picky about who they subject to ""intense interrogation."" 
	
	
 The more fundamental problem, though, has to do with logic. Is the war on terrorism a war or is it not? Many (including me) saw the attacks on New York as a monstrous criminal outrage, rather than an act of war. But President George W. Bush determined otherwise. By treating Sept. 11 as war, Bush was able to call into play the right of self-defence mandated by the United Nations. But if Sept. 11 was an act of war, then it becomes, in a weird way, less monstrous. Both New York City and the Pentagon are legitimate wartime targets - the former economic, the latter military. Anyone waging war on the U.S. would have targeted Manhattan in the hope of damaging the American economy - as the World Trade Center attack did. 
	
	
 So if Sept. 11 was an act of war, why are those captured in the aftermath not treated as prisoners of war? It is considered legitimate self-defence for the U.S. and its allies to invade Afghanistan. Why is it not considered equally legitimate for the Afghans and their allies to resist this invasion? 
	
	
 These are not abstract questions. Countries sign on to the Geneva Convention not to be altruistic but to ensure that their own soldiers will be well treated if captured. The assumption is that what we do to them will be done to us. Let us hope that, in this instance, the terrible equation does not hold.

 ""I would like to visit various countries at a more leisurely pace -- meet with the people of the land and travel not only to the capital but also to rural cities for sightseeing,"" the premier told a gathering in Tokyo. 
	
	
 ""But when I think of my duties as prime minister, I can't visit one country and not go to the other, or stay in one country for three days and stay in the other for only a day. If I am to visit several countries in a limited time, it is always one or two days at best,"" he said.

SARAJEVO, Jan 18 (ONASA) -- The decision on extradition of six Algerians to the United States is in accordance with the responsibility and authorities of the BiH Federation bodies and international obligations, the coordination team for anti-terrorism said in a statement on Friday [18 January]. 
	
	
 ""One cannot neglect the fact that BiH, as member of the United Nations, is obliged to strictly respect the UN resolution dated September 28 last year, which obliges UN members to cooperate on the plan of exchange of information and cooperation on prevention of terrorist activities,"" read a statement from the team. 
	
	
 Bosnian authorities have handed over to US custody six Algerians detained in October on suspicion of involvement in terrorism but ordered released this week by a local court, the US embassy said on Friday. 
	
	
 In Washington, a senior official told Reuters the US military planned to quickly move the six to the American Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where al-Qa'ida and Taliban detainees from the war in Afghanistan are being held. 
	
	
 ""The plan is to move them to Guantanamo Bay,"" the US official said, without specifying when. 
	
	
 Earlier, the US embassy in Sarajevo said in a statement: ""The six Algerian nationals who have been detained by BiH (Bosnia and Herzegovina) authorities since mid-October have been transferred to US custody. 
	
	
 ""We have taken custody of these individuals due to our concern about their activity in BiH, which both posed a credible security threat to US personnel and facilities and demonstrated involvement in international terrorism,"" it said. 
	
	
 Washington insisted it would not have acted without credible evidence, but the transfer exposed it to more criticism from campaigners who have accused it of disregarding human rights in its declared ""war on terror."" 
	
	
 The six have been accused of having links to the al-Qa'ida network of fugitive Usama Bin Ladin. 
	
	
 A Bosnian government official said legal procedures had been respected in the case, but a senior UN human rights officer in Bosnia said they had been ""trampled over."" 
	
	
 Not only had a court ordered their release on Thursday but the state's top human rights body had instructed authorities to prevent four being taken out of the country by force. 
	
	
 ""It's very disappointing,"" Madeleine Rees, head of the Bosnia office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said of the operation. ""It violates the rule of law."" 
	
	
 Washington is already under fire from human rights groups for its treatment of prisoners captured in Afghanistan and held at Guantanamo Bay. 
	
	
 The United States has not given the captives the status of prisoners of war, which would grant them certain rights under the 1949 Geneva Convention. 
	
	
 The Supreme Court of Bosnia's Muslim-Croat federation ruled on Thursday there was no reason to detain the six. All were Algerians, although one also had a Yemeni passport possibly obtained fraudulently, international officials said. 
	
	
 Local police arrested them in October, acting on a US tip after threats closed the US and British embassies for several days. International officials said US officials had not been willing to provide Bosnia's justice system with the intelligence information that prompted their detention. 
	
	
 Five of the six also held Bosnian citizenship but were stripped of it after their arrest. The men had appealed against that decision, however, and Rees said they should not have been deported until that process was complete. 
	
	
 A Bosnian government official insisted the appeal had already been rejected and legal procedures had been followed. 
	
	
 He said the government had not been aware of the ruling by Bosnia's Human Rights Chamber that measures should be taken to stop four of the suspects being taken out of the country. 
	
	
 ""The legal procedure in this case has been fully respected so far,"" said Jusif Halilagic, a deputy minister who represents the government in the chamber. 
	
	
 More than 100 protesters gathered outside Sarajevo's central prison on Thursday night. They tried to block vehicles presumably taking the suspects to hand them over to US forces. 
	
	
 US soldiers form a substantial part of Bosnia's NATO-led peacekeeping force. 
	
	
 The US embassy said the suspects would be treated humanely and in accordance with international law.

GENEVA, Jan 18 (AFP) -- A report by delegates from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), currently visiting prisoners from Afghanistan held at a US base in Cuba, will remain confidential, an ICRC spokesman said on Friday [18 January]. 
	
	
 Darcy Christen also said that among the prisoners transferred to the US navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were three British citizens and possibly some French speakers. 
	
	
 However, the Geneva-based ICRC did not know the number nor the nationality, he said following a comment on Thursday that there could have been French nationals among them. 
	
	
 ICRC envoys are discussing with US officials whether to release the number of detainees and their nationalities, said Christen. 
	
	
 The findings from the visit, which got under way on Friday and is expected to last at least one week, will be presented directly to US authorities, Christen told reporters. 
	
	
 ""Confidentiality will be respected in this case. As long as this confidentiality will allow us to get results in the humanitarian sphere we will keep to it,"" he said, adding it would be the first of a series of visits. 
	
	
 The four-member team, which includes a doctor, will inspect conditions and treatment of the increasing number of Taliban and al-Qa'ida prisoners arriving at the base from Afghanistan. 
	
	
 The ICRC plans follow up on prisoners if they are transferred again later, and try to gain access to new arrivals in coming days. 
	
	
 ""It is important to be able to repeat these visits,"" he said. 
	
	
 The number of detainees being held at the isolated US military outpost on Cuba's southwestern coast rose on Thursday to 110 after the arrival of another 30 prisoners from Afghanistan. 
	
	
 The US has caused controversy by stating the detainees are ""unlawful combatants"" and have no rights under the Geneva Convention. 
	
	
 The ICRC considers, however, that they are prisoners of war protected by the Third Geneva Convention of 1949. 
	
	
 Christen said ""detainees from the battle field"" did not exist as a category under humanitarian law, adding that in an international armed conflict anyone captured on the battlefield was presumed a prisoner of war. 
	
	
 ""If a doubt exists as to the status of a person, this doubt must be decided by a tribunal acting on the basis of judicial guarantees,"" he added. 
	
	
 Asked about special courts to be set up by the Bush administration to try the al-Qaeda detainees, Christen pointed out the courts were not yet operating and their procedures were still unknown. 
	
	
 ""For us there cannot be special courts. We want to avoid expeditious justice,"" he said.

LONDON, Jan 18 (AFP) -- British officials have arrived at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and are assessing the conditions of three British prisoners among the 110 suspected al-Qa'ida fighters held there by the US, the Foreign Office said on Friday. 
	
	
 A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""I can confirm a team of British officials are in the process of visiting the detainees at Guantanamo Bay. They arrived overnight. 
	
	
 ""They are going about their task that has been set for them, identifying those who claim to be British citizens and reporting on the welfare of those who claim to be British citizens and assisting the US authorities with legal inquiries into the terrorist atrocities."" 
	
	
 The United States earlier this week said British diplomats could have access to Britons held among the detainees, whose cramped and spartan conditions have caused much criticism among human rights groups around the world. 
	
	
 London insists it supports US reassurances that the men are being treated humanely, although there has also been criticism here over why it was taking diplomats so long to see the men. 
	
	
 The prisoners are being held at a temporary outdoor detention facility called ""Camp X-Ray"" where each has a separate cell with a concrete floor, wooden roof and chain-link walls. They have a mat to sleep on and two towels, one to be used as a prayer rug. 
	
	
 A four-member International Red Cross team flew into the US navy base on Cuban soil on Thursday and was due to begin interviewing detainees later Friday. 
	
	
 A spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair refused to say how many British officials had travelled to the camp.

The profound economic crisis in Argentina has coincided with a wave of social tension during recent days. Riots and widespread strikes, attacks on government buildings, and the plundering of stores have left scores of dead and casualties. Public dissatisfaction and an increase in the people's anger in this country have finally resulted in the collapse of Fernando Delaroe's government following several days of protest. 
	
	
 Because of the misguided policies of Argentina's politicians, Argentina is in a state of stagnation for a fourth consecutive years. The unemployment rate has passed 18 percent and the hard currency is continuously being devalued. Foreign debts are around $132 billion and poverty is dominating the country like a dangerous virus. 
	
	
 The important point is that Argentina has enjoyed the IMF's advice in the execution of these policies. The main problem that caused the recent shock is also a result of the restrictive economic policies that have been adopted on the advice of IMF experts. Incidentally, the riots also occurred following the IMF's announcement of Argentina's debts. 
	
	
 What is clear is that Argentina's paralyzed economy was unable to tolerate the government's hardline policies, which finally resulted in the situation that we are witnessing today. Although IMF officials deny any connection their policies and the current situation, reports indicate that now an IMF executive delegation is actively making changes to Argentina's economy. Another important point is Argentina's connections with the global economy. This country has attracted a large amount of foreign investment by international companies, from the American continent to Europe. Some $76 billion of the $132 billion debt is accounted for by foreign loans, which were lavished on Argentina. Anyway, now in addition to the IMF, the US government, as the biggest investor in Argentina's economy, is ignoring its commitments in the current situation. 
	
	
 In the heat of crisis, the interim government has introduced new initiatives. Among them are halting the payment of debts and the execution of supportive actions for the poor people, controlling government and state expenses, attempts to increase employment, giving food help and trying to take out new loans, and the adoption of new monetary policies. However, there are a few ambiguous points, such as: 
	
	
 1 -- What amount of Argentina's economic crisis is due to its relations with the global economy and how much effect will it have on the European and US economies due to its present stagnation? 
	
	
 2 -- What reaction is likely from other countries and international institutions to the government's new policies, for instance halting the payment of debts? 
	
	
 3 -- Finally, what fate awaits Argentina's crisis-stricken economy?

LONDON, Jan 19 (AFP) -- British members of parliament Saturday [19 January] called for a meeting with the US ambassador and urged the government to make a clear statement in response to growing concerns about the treatment of al-Qa'ida suspects, including three Britons, held at an US detention centre in Cuba. 
	
	
 The cross-party Parliamentary Human Rights Committee said it was lobbying for a meeting with US ambassador to London William Farish over fears that the 110 detainees held at Camp X-Ray, Guantanamo Bay, are being kept in inhumane conditions. 
	
	
 The makeshift outdoor facility houses single cells, each with a concrete floor, wooden roof and chain-link walls. 
	
	
 The United States says the detainees are illegal combatants, not prisoners of war, and thus do not have rights under the Geneva Convention of 1949, which sets out the laws of war. 
	
	
 London meanwhile insists it supports US reassurances that the men are being treated humanely. 
	
	
 Ann Clwyd, chairperson for the committee and a member of the ruling Labour party, said it was ""playing with words"" to suggest that the detainees were not prisoners of war. 
	
	
 Clwyd said the purpose of meeting Farish was to ""to voice concern about the treatment of all the people taken prisoner in Afghanistan, not just the ones being held in Cuba, and we want an acceptance that they are prisoners of war."" 
	
	
 She added that there was ""substantial concern"" among Labour members and called for a government statement on the situation. 
	
	
 ""It's time we had a clear statement on the position of the prisoners and what the British role now is. We fought the war shoulder to shoulder, now it seems that we are being frozen out of the aftermath. 
	
	
 ""It's time we became much firmer with the Americans and insisted on the human rights we are all signed up to."" 
	
	
 The government has sent a team of officials to the camp to assess the conditions of the British prisoners. 
	
	
 Newspaper reports here Saturday said that it had also sent intelligence agents to interrogate the detainees, something the Foreign Office refused to comment on.

[As of filing time, the UK media monitored by FBIS have not been observed to report the statement by UK Foreign Secretary Straw cited below] 
	
	
 LONDON, Jan 20 (AFP) -- Britain said Sunday [20 January] that al-Qa'ida suspects held at a US base in Cuba must be treated humanely, following the release of photographs showing prisoners kneeling, manacled, blindfolded and wearing ear muffs. 
	
	
 ""The British government's position is that prisoners, regardless of their technical status, should be treated humanely and in accordance with customary international law,"" said Foreign Secretary Jack Straw in a statement. 
	
	
 ""We have always made that clear and the Americans have said they share this view."" 
	
	
 He also said Britain was seeking information from the United States about the circumstances in which photographs of the detainees, which appeared on the front pages of British newspapers Sunday, were taken. 
	
	
 The 110 prisoners were brought to Camp X-Ray in Guantanamo Bay after being captured during the US-led military campaign in Afghanistan include three Britons. 
	
	
 Pictures taken by a US Navy officer and released to the media show a group of prisoners, suspected members of Usama Bin Ladin's al-Qa'ida network, kneeling in orange jump suits and mancled at the waist. They are wearing dark goggles to blot out the light, ear muffs to keep out sound and mittens. 
	
	
 The right-wing Mail on Sunday, which could normally be expected to support the United States over its ""war on terrorism"", ran the photographs under the headline ""Tortured"". 
	
	
 ""They (the prisoners) can hear nothing, smell nothing, feel nothing,"" the middle-market tabloid said. 
	
	
 ""Manacled hand and foot, they kneel in submission. Is this how (US president George W.) Bush and (British Prime Minister Tony) Blair defend our civilisation?"" 
	
	
 The pictures of the detainees ""shackled like wild animals"" were so shocking that they were ""certain to intensify the international outrage at the conditions in which they are being kept"" the Mail on Sunday said. 
	
	
 Straw pointed out the United States had accepted visits to Guantanamo Bay by a team from the International Committee of the Red Cross and by British officials. 
	
	
 ""I await the British officials' report. As for the photographs of detainees published today, I have asked our officials in Guantanamo Bay to establish with the US the circumstances in which these photographs were taken."" 
	
	
 The United States says the detainees are illegal combatants, not prisoners of war, and thus do not have rights under the Geneva Convention of 1949, which sets out the laws of war. 
	
	
 London has previously insisted it supports US reassurances that the men are being treated humanely.

TOKYO, Jan 21 (AFP) - Japan on Monday deployed some 3,000 police at a two-day Afghan reconstruction meeting here after a series of minor explosions were reported in the capital this month. 
	
	
 ""We are deploying 3,000 police officers for the Afghan conference,"" said a spokesman for the Tokyo metropolitan police department. 
	
	
 ""We boosted security so that we will be able to handle any kind of incident, including terrorism,"" the spokesman said. 
	
	
 Participants in the meeting included Afghan interim administration chairman Hamid Karzai, US State Secretary Colin Powell, US Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and World Bank President James Wolfensohn. 
	
	
 The meeting came two days after a 53-year-old homeless man was seriously injured in an explosion at a park in Tokyo's business and entertainment district of Shinjuku. 
	
	
 The explosion -- apparently caused by a device left in a rubbish bin -- which occurred seven kilometres (4.3 miles) away from the conference venue on Saturday, blew off the victim's lower left arm, injured his leg and left him in a coma. 
	
	
 It was the third explosion since early January in Tokyo. No one has yet been arrested. News reports said all the explosions were suspected to have been set by one person or one group.

Spanish daily warns USA its treatment of suspects could alienate allies 
	
	
 Text of unsigned editorial, ""Prisoners in Guantanamo"", by Spanish newspaper El Pais web site on 21|January 
	
	
 The USA's credibility will be tarnished if it allows the prisoners captured in Afghanistan and transferred to Guantanamo, the naval base it holds in Cuba, to face military courts without any guarantee whatsoever of a fair trial. If the Bush administration is stubborn enough to persist with this attitude, it could cause a rift with a European public opinion that showed only solidarity and generosity after the terrorist attacks of 11 September. It could also alienate itself from a large part of its allies, even if, militarily speaking, Washington is conducting its campaign in virtual isolation. The emergency legislation carried through in the wake of 11 September means that the USA does not see these detainees from Afghanistan as prisoners of war to be treated according to the Geneva Convention, whose 1997 protocol it has yet to sign, but as ""unlawful combatants"", or ""people arrested on the battlefield"". According to the US administration, they can be tried outside US territory before secret military courts and they can be condemned, even to death, without the assurance of having been found guilty ""beyond all reasonable doubt"". A court-martial according to the usual procedure would have guaranteed them a much sturdier legal defence. The US Association of Legal Professionals is of the opinion that these military tribunals cannot pass sentence on any crimes other than those derived from violations of the right to war. A clear contradiction of this situation is the fact that, in response to a terrorist action, Washington has gone to war in Afghanistan, even if it hasn't officially declared war on the country. The Geneva Convention rules that prisoners must be freed or repatriated after the hostilities have ended. It so happens that among the detainees taken to Guantanamo there are three British nationals, an Australian and various Saudis, amongst others. Australia has already said it would prefer a civil trial or an international tribunal. It is an idea that could be worked on, especially since, in contrast to the fate of those held at the Cuban base, John Walker, the 20-year-old US ""convert"" to the Taleban being held in Afghanistan, will be tried with the full protection of the law by a civil court in the USA and, at the moment, stands accused of crimes that do not carry the death penalty, although they could put him in jail for life. Everyone should be given the same opportunities and protection before the law so, by the same token, suspected members of Al-Qa'idah being held in Europe, whose numbers have risen in recent days, will be tried by civil courts, including in Spain. A team from the International Red Cross is interviewing each of more than 100 Taleban and Al-Qa'idah members being held prisoner in Guantanamo about the treatment they are receiving, a situation that Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has said does not interest him. Humanitarian organizations, however, believe that the Geneva Convention can be applied to these prisoners and that it states that they must be treated humanely and be subject to other rights in the place that has been baptized ""Camp X-Ray"", in allusion to the building of the covered sheds with barbed wire in place of walls [that house the prisoners]. It may be the moment to offer the world's television channels, from CNN to Qatar's Al-Jazeera, full access [to the camp]. Guaranteeing justice in the way we perceive it, even for the possible promoters of terrorism, is a question of principles that impedes, among other things, comparisons with the regime on the other side of the fence to the US base. Perhaps this is why Fidel Castro has not spoken out against what might go on in Guantanamo.

Spanish daily urges USA to end ""inhumane treatment"" of Al-Qa'idah suspects 
	
	
 Text of unsigned editorial, ""Guantanamo: a prison with no law"", by Spanish newspaper El Mundo web site on 21|January 
	
	
 As Amnesty International has pointedly remarked, the photographs of the detainees in Guantanamo that the US army has unashamedly seen fit to release are reminiscent of the torture centres of eastern Europe in the Cold War. Holding detainees in handcuffs and shackles is not acceptable in a democracy, nor is depriving them of all their senses by putting blindfolds over their eyes, surgical masks over their mouths and noses, and gloves on their hands to disorientate them and subject them to sensory deprivation. The official explanations - they had just got off the plane, the masks are for fear of spreading tuberculosis, they are dangerous - hardly ring true, they discredit the USA and would seem to confirm the prevalent assumption in many allied countries that the superpower has decided to wage war and administer justice all on its own. Proof of that is the refusal to treat the 110 detainees in Guantanamo and the hundreds held in Afghanistan as prisoners of war. For Amnesty International, the Red Cross and any self-respecting democrat, they are prisoners of war and should be treated according the Geneva Convention. In the event of disagreement, as is the case now, with the USA insisting that the issue concerns terrorists who do not belong to any state and who do not have rights as prisoners, the final decision should be left in the hands of ""an appropriate tribunal"", which must be impartial and independent, as Article 5 of the third Geneva Convention states. Even before these pictures [were released], Human Rights Watch had described the 1.8 by 2.4 metre cages where the prisoners are held as scandalous. The fact that the photographs have been distributed to the press voluntarily by the US authorities would suggest that they aren't even aware of what they are doing or, worse still, that they don't care. ""They're terrorists, they're murderers and the USA will treat them as it pleases,"" is Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's reply to the critics. Fortunately, not everyone in the Bush administration is of the same opinion. Thanks to their efforts and to pressure from allied governments, notably the British government, the commandant at Guantanamo has now allowed the Red Cross into the base with the freedom to interview as many detainees as they please. It's a step in the right direction, but it's only the start. The sooner the inhumane treatment of detainees is put to a end, the better.

Urumqi, January 21 (XINHUA) -- The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in northwest China will invest 420 billion yuan (51 billion U.S. dollars) in fixed assets during the country's 10th Five-Year Plan period for 2001-2005, compared with 254 billion yuan in the 1996-2000 period. 
	
	
 Nearly 60 percent of the investment will come from the central government and state-owned enterprises, a local official said Monday. 
	
	
 In 2001, the region's investment in fixed assets increased 15 percent year on year to 70.6 billion yuan, with investment in technical renovation and real estate development up 23.9 and 65.5 percent, respectively. 
	
	
 Fixed asset investment planned for this year will be 80.7 billion yuan, an increase of 15.2 percent. The money will mainly be used for the construction of 27 key projects in the fields of water conservancy, energy, transportation and environmental protection. 
	
	
 Wang Lequan, secretary of the regional committee of the Communist Party of China, has listed comprehensive treatment of the Tarim River and the project to ship natural gas from Xinjiang to eastern China as the most important projects for this year. 
	
	
 In 1996-2000, Xinjiang completed a big number of major transportation, energy, water conservancy and telecommunications projects with 254 billion yuan of fixed asset investment. 
	
	
 Upon operation of the double-track railway line linking Lanzhou in Gansu Province with Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang, and the southern Xinjiang railway line which links Kashi with Turpan, the mileage of railways in Xinjiang has reached 3,008 km. 
	
	
 Xinjiang now also has 33,500 km of highways, with more than 60 air routes linking the region with the outside world.

Text of report in English by Russian news agency Interfax 
	
	
 Moscow, 21 January: President Vladimir Putin visited the Khrunichev space centre on Monday evening [21 January]. In one of the workshops, he was told in detail about manned and unmanned spacecraft. The centre's chief, Aleksandr Medvedev, reported to the president about the development of Russia's segment on board the International Space Station [ISS]. Rosaviakosmos Director Yuriy Koptev, in his turn, told the president that, at present, Russia was actively interacting with European countries on ""the interchangeability"" of the ISS' American segment. Koptev explained that the USA has suspended the ISS development programme until a deficit of 4.7bn dollars is paid off. According to Koptev, such interaction with Europe would make it possible for six spacemen to be on board the ISS rather than the current three, as well as to use a Russian Soyuz rocket as a rescue spaceship. The director-general of the Khrunichev centre briefed the head of state on how the heavy Proton rocket-booster had been upgraded. According to the director, it is this rocket booster that launches almost all of Russia's military and civilian satellites into space. According to Medvedev, the main upgrading work included ""the replacement of the control system, improvement of design data, the determination of ecological measures at the first stage, and the improvement of the rocket-booster at the boosting unit's expense."" The upgrading and especially the last part - the boosting unit - have made it possible ""to surge on the foreign market"" and provided for a great economic and commercial effect from the launch of an upgraded Proton rocket-booster, said Medvedev. In all, since the first launch of Proton in 1965, according to Medvedev, 284 launches of this rocket have been made, all from the Baykonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Accompanying the president at the Khrunichev centre are Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, deputy chief of Presidential Administration, Sergey Prikhodko; chief of staff, Anatoliy Kvashnin, presidential assistant, Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov, Deputy Defence Minister Aleksey Moskovskiy and Space Forces Commander Anatoliy Perminov.

In an antiterrorist war that at the time was initially launched as Operation Infinite Justice, it is infinitely difficult to reconcile oneself to the pictures of chained and humiliated Taliban and al-Qaida prisoners at the U.S. Guantanamo base on Cuba. The pictures resemble an attempt to satisfy a primitive thirst for revenge and convince the Americans that the Bush administration has not only succeeded in removing a regime of religious madmen in out-of-the-way Afghanistan, but also in taking prisoner some of those responsible for the terrorist acts on that day in September. 
	
	
 The U.S. and most recently the British governments reject the suggestion that the prisoners are being harmed, but this does not alter the fact that the pictures of hooded prisoners in chains are in themselves enough to paint a picture of a United States that in the name of self-righteousness - and equally worryingly: without any great amount of debate - has allowed itself to infringe international rules. 
	
	
 This impression is reinforced by the fact that for the time being at least the United States has ignored the Geneva Convention and refused to treat those taken prisoner as prisoners of war - something to which they have a right - until a competent court has decided differently. 
	
	
 Instead the superpower has entered a legal fog where the prisoners have been stamped with a nonsense term in international law: ""battlefield prisoners."" As such they face the prospect of being subjected to the due course of law and in the final analysis perhaps sentenced to death in closed military courts instead of in open courts, as is the right of prisoners of war under the terms of the Geneva Convention. 
	
	
 For most people it will of course be difficult to mobilize any great degree of understanding for those responsible for the bloody terrorism in the United States on that day in September, but what is at issue here is that at the present moment principles are at stake that could have far-reaching repercussions for the future war against terrorism. 
	
	
 With its behavior, therefore, the United States is not only compromising the image of the war against terrorism as an expression of a higher form of justice, but also of itself as an unshakeable defender of this same justice. This will undoubtedly rub off on the superpower's allies, including Denmark. And for this reason, too, they have a moral duty to speak out, as Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh, among others, did yesterday. Otherwise they face the risk not only of undermining the legitimacy of their own antiterrorism war at present, but also of sending out a signal that despots around the world will know how to exploit. 
	
	
 Many of them have already demonstrated great skill in their own behavior when it comes to exploiting the West's fear of terrorism.

Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen (Liberal Party) has voiced his approval of the U.S. treatment of the 144 al-Qaida prisoners at the U.S. Guantanamo military base on Cuba. 
	
	
 ""The U.S. Government has announced that the United States will respect its international commitments,"" Fogh Rasmussen said at his weekly press conference on Tuesday [22 January]. 
	
	
 He points out that the United States has allowed the Red Cross to inspect conditions at the Guantanamo base. 
	
	
 Criticism From the Red Cross 
	
	
 He fails to mention, however, that on the international stage the Red Cross has subsequently criticized the U.S. treatment of prisoners. 
	
	
 EU foreign affairs spokesman Javier Solana, among others, has also criticized the United States for not recognizing the al-Qaida prisoners as prisoners of war as understood in the Geneva Convention. 
	
	
 The Swedish Government has also expressed concern about the prisoners' rights. 
	
	
 Fogh: They Must Be Given a Fair Trial 
	
	
 ""The prisoners must be treated with respect for their integrity and religion, and they must be given a fair trial,"" Fogh Rasmussen says. 
	
	
 On Monday Liberal Party foreign affairs spokesman Troels Lund Poulsen said that the debate on prisoners' rights is ""an intellectual discussion."" 
	
	
 Per Stig Moller: Give Them Rights 
	
	
 Foreign Minister Per Stig Moller (Conservative People's Party) is urging the United States to guarantee the prisoners the status of prisoners of war and in consequence protection under the terms of the Geneva Convention. 
	
	
 ""I expect the United States to satisfy the requirements of the international conventions,"" Per Stig Moller said at a press conference in Berlin on Monday. 
	
	
 "" Social Democratic Party: Raise Denmark's Voice 
	
	
 The Social Democratic Party takes the view that the Danish Government should raise its voice against the United States. 
	
	
 ""I do not have all the information, but there are some questionable aspects in the U.S. approach,"" political spokesman Mogens Lykketoft (Social Democratic Party) told Ritzau Bureau. 
	
	
 ""Of course the United States has a point when it says that it can be difficult to decide who are terrorists and who are prisoners of war. We must focus on the treatment of them."" 
	
	
 The Socialist People's Party is sending an ""urgent call"" to the government to deliver official criticism to the United States. 
	
	
 ""It cannot be the duty of the Danish Government to applaud everything that the Americans do. Even though we support their action, we should criticize this form of treatment of prisoners,"" Socialist People's Party Chairman Holger K. Nielsen said. 
	
	
 He will now ask the foreign minister to give a written reply outlining the government's position on the issue. 
	
	
 Danish People's Party: Are They Danes? 
	
	
 The Danish People's Party sees no reason to criticize the United States. 
	
	
 ""To begin with, I have great confidence that what the Americans are doing in relation to these prisoners is reasonable. I can imagine that the United States has had good reasons for transporting them to Cuba,"" foreign affairs spokesman Peter Skaarup (Danish People's Party) says. 
	
	
 As long as no Danes are involved, the Danish People's Party does not think that Denmark should interfere. 
	
	
 ""This could of course become necessary if a Dane were involved. Otherwise it must be a matter between the United States and the countries which have citizens who are directly affected,"" Peter Skaarup said, alluding to the United Kingdom and Sweden.

Spanish daily urges caution in judging USA's treatment of suspects 
	
	
 Text of unsigned editorial, ""Treatment of the prisoners"", by Spanish newspaper ABC web site on 22|January 
	
	
 The dissemination of some photos taken of a group of detainees in Guantanamo has aroused international controversy. Critics condemn the inhumane nature of the treatment the prisoners are receiving, handcuffed, immobilized with shackles, subjected to sensory deprivation and confined to minute cells. If these accusations are confirmed, the only possible definition will be torture and the violation of human rights. However, we may be witnessing a distortion of reality, and even in some cases pure falsehoods. The photos were sent voluntarily to the press by the American authorities, who clarified that they depicted a group of 20 dangerous prisoners who had recently arrived at the base and undergone a process of identification prior to their confinement. These were in no way their normal living conditions. But the decisive fact is the presence for days of the International Committee of the Red Cross, which is preparing a report and which, as usual, has refused to make any statements. It will speak in its report. Herein lies the difference. In the countries in which torture is systematically carried out, for example Cuba or China, inspection by international organizations is not permitted. The result of the report will have to be taken into account before political and moral judgments of guilty or not guilty are made. For the time being, the members of the British government who interviewed three prisoners of their nationality have received no complaints about the treatment they are receiving. Indications exist that the system to which the prisoners are subjected is excessively harsh. The United States government does not help dispel the suspicions when it refuses to consider them prisoners of war and therefore to apply the Geneva Convention to them. Nor does it seem proper to cite the fact that the base is not on American soil because it is a rented base. Backing from a majority of the public would not serve, either, as justification for the possible excesses and violations of rights. But for the time being, what exist are indications and shadows of suspicion which must materialize or be dispelled through knowledge of the facts from the relevant reports. It is another matter to launch into scandal or anti-Americanism. In any case, the attitude of the American authorities has nothing to do with the one previously and currently displayed by dictatorships and totalitarian systems, including communist ones, which permit neither inspection nor the dissemination of photographs. But this enormous difference is not enough. It must be known as soon as possible whether or not terror has been established in Guantanamo.

The attacks on the World Trade Center Towers and the Pentagon were attacks on the freedoms and values for which the United States and the Western world stand, President Bush declared shortly afterward, and many people in Europe repeated it after him. 
	
	
 There is a great deal of truth in that, but in the light of what has happened afterwards, the question arises as to whether the Americans and their allies themselves are not sometimes inclined to sacrifice these values for the ""good cause."" There is no doubt that a military operation and intensified security measures were imperative after the terrible tragedy of 11 September. That al-Qa'ida terrorists and Taliban fighters are not very concerned about the human suffering that they have caused is also generally known. However, the ends -- dealing with those opponents -- does not justify all the means. 
	
	
 There is, in the first place, the case of the military action in Afghanistan. Apart from the reasons or justification for such an action, all the combatants' war conduct must be constantly tested against the standards of international humanitarian law; that is, the rules which curb the use of force during a military operation. Back in 1949, it was agreed by nearly all the states in the world that the sufferings of war must henceforth become more bearable, especially for those who are not directly involved in the conflict. These rules, laid down in the four Geneva Conventions, provide, among other things, for the protection of sick and wounded servicemen and prisoners of war. In addition, attempts must be made to prevent any unnecessary suffering by both military personnel and civilians by, for instance, imposing restrictions on the use of weapons. 
	
	
 But the greatest attention is paid to the fate of the civilian population: In principle, the latter can never be the object of a military operation. Hence, humanitarian law requires that in all circumstances a distinction be made between military targets and those not involved in the armed conflict. The two supplementary protocols to the Geneva Conventions, adopted in 1977, increase, among other things, the protection of the civilian population. Many countries are parties to them, but the United States has not ratified these protocols, so that the additional protection they offer is difficult to enforce in a conflict in which US troops are taking part. 
	
	
 Although it is doubtful that all the news reaches us from Afghanistan, a great many press reports suggest that humanitarian law was violated regularly over the past few weeks. This has happened despite solemn pledges to the United Nations that the United States ""is committed to minimizing civilian casualties and damage to civilian property."" 
	
	
 Hence you can hardly speak of a ""targeting error"" when a Red Cross warehouse, although clearly recognizable by the large red cross painted on the roof, was shelled twice by US aircraft. Such a building enjoys the highest possible protection, and can and should never be the object of an attack, unless it is clearly established that it is being used for military purposes. 
	
	
 In other case, too, it seems doubtful that the crucial distinction between military and civilian targets was made systematically. Newspaper headlines such as ""United Nations Confirms US Bombing of Village and Mosque"" and ""100 Killed in Bombing in Eastern Afghanistan"" speak for themselves. According to witnesses, these were attacks in an area where neither al-Qa'ida troops nor Taliban had been observed. Even if these attacks were directed against a clear military target, the large number of civilian casualties would still never be justifiable, because whoever plans a military attack must take all precautions to prevent such a tragedy. 
	
	
 Not only with the protection of the civilian population does something sometimes go wrong. Secretary Rumsfeld's statements (on 20 November 2001) that ""the United States is not inclined to negotiate surrenders, nor are we in a position, with relatively small numbers of forces on the ground, to accept prisoners,"" and that ""my hope is that they will be either killed or taken prisoner (by the Northern Alliance)"" also suggested that death would be the only way out of the conflict for the Taliban and al-Qa'ida fighters. That would amount to a flagrant violation of humanitarian law: whoever ceases fighting for whatever reason is entitled to protection. It is all the more to be deplored that such statements come from somebody who, as a senior commander, serves as an example to others regarding the observance of rules of humanitarian law. 
	
	
 Now, nearly two months later, concern about the fate of the captive Taliban and al-Qa'ida fighters has further increased. Moving the captives to the Guantanamo Bay military base on Cuba is rightly whipping up a storm of protest. Humanitarian law leaves no doubt that those who fall captive in their opponent's hands are entitled at all times to decent treatment, even if they do not qualify for prisoner of war status. Transporting these people, shackled hand and foot and with hoods over their heads, shaving their beards -- which form part of their religious identity -- and their ""accommodation"" in half-open and cages that are much too small can probably never pass this test... 
	
	
 The consequences of 11 September are also making themselves felt far from the battlefield. Shortly after its decision to take military action, the Bush administration also decided to provide the press with only sparse information about the course of the operation. Because press freedom -- the jewel of the US Constitution -- can be restricted for reasons of national security. The right of citizens to such information about their government's actions is crippled by the fact that it is being accepted for the present without much complaint. 
	
	
 Under the protest of international and US human rights organizations but with the approval of large sections of the population, antiterrorism measures are being adopted in great haste. Foreigners suspected of maintaining (loose) ties with terrorist organizations can be detained indefinitely. There is uncertainty about the precise number, but it is certain that over 1,000 men from the Middle East have already been arrested. 
	
	
 In the media, the possibility of questioning presumed terrorists very roughly is also being considered aloud. The need for timely and accurate information about possible new attacks is naturally particularly great, but whether the global ban on torture can be abused on that account is another matter. 
	
	
 What raises even more questions is the order that President Bush issued last November. Through that, the United States can detain and try anybody who is not a US citizen and who is suspected of being a member of al-Qa'ida or of being involved in international terrorism in one way or another. Only special military commissions can try them. It is stated in black and white that it is hardly feasible for these commissions to apply the normal principles of law and rules of evidence. Consequently, evidence will be accepted that ""a normal person"" deems to have the value of evidence. Hence guilt need not be established ""beyond reasonable doubt,"" nor is there any mention of a presumption of innocence. Appeal is not possible, but the death penalty is. On the other hand, US Taliban or al-Qa'ida fighters, such as the recently captured John Walker Lindh, will be tried by ordinary US criminal courts. 
	
	
 There also seems to be a difference among the foreigners: In all likelihood, captured British fighters will be sent to Britain after questioning. Presumed war criminals such as Milosevic enjoy all the guarantees of a fair trial, but the Taliban and al-Qa'ida fighters at Guantanamo will get a trial which falls far short of the basic standards of the US Constitution and the treaty on civil and political rights ratified by the United States. 
	
	
 Not in the United States alone are the screws being tightened. A number of other countries have sharpened their laws following 11 September, from increased detention possibilities to stricter legislation on asylum and immigration. In December 2001, the UK proclaimed a state of emergency and passed the Antiterrorism, Crime, and Security Act. Whenever there is a suspicion that a foreigner is involved in international terrorism, he will be arrested and imprisoned. If it emerges that the person concerned cannot be removed from British territory because he is in serious danger in his own country, he can be detained almost indefinitely under this law. 
	
	
 Other states have used the US tragedy to polish their own image. Out of well-understood self-interest, countries such as Russia, China, and Israel joined in the Bush administration's anti-terrorism campaign, because it enabled them to compare their domestic situation with the US situation and ask for moral support for the fight they have been waging against terrorism for years. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon called Palestinian leader Arafat ""Our Usama Bin Ladin."" 
	
	
 The fight against terrorism is undoubtedly justified, but, as with every struggle, it also holds true that the fundamental principles of human rights and humanitarian law must be respected. Observance of these rules will not insure that the fight against terrorism is lost; it will prove respect for human dignity, of which the West is rightly a champion.

 The Nikkei's downside was supported by buybacks and bargain-hunting in reaction to the previous day's 2% fall, which left the index only a step away from the 10,000 line. 
	
	
 ""The Nikkei is fluctuating at a level which induces buybacks for technical reasons,"" said Kazunori Jinnai, general manager at the equity department of Daiwa Securities SMBC Co. 
	
	
 Some chip-related issues such as Tokyo Electron and Advantest ended the morning higher despite an overnight fall in U.S. stocks. 
	
	
 In New York on Tuesday, the Nasdaq composite index plunged 47.81 points, or 2.48%, to close at 1,882.53 and the 30-issue Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 58.05 points, or 0.59%, to 9,713.80. 
	
	
 Brokers said chip-related issues in Tokyo got a boost from an international trade association saying North America-based manufacturers of semiconductor equipment saw orders and shipments rise in December. 
	
	
 Export-dependent automakers also contributed to the Nikkei's rise, with Toyota Motor gaining 20 yen to 3,470 yen and Honda Motor 70 yen to 5,230 yen. 
	
	
 Rubber makers and nonferrous metal firms led the rise, while telecoms, real estate companies, and banks were soft in the morning. NTT hit a record low of 377,000 yen before ending the morning at 383,000. 
	
	
 The volume leader was machinery maker Yuken Kogyo, which shot up 28 yen to 152 yen. 
	
	
 Snow Brand Milk Products dived 37 yen to 187 yen after media reported earlier Wednesday that its subsidiary Snow Brand Food is suspected of disguising Australian beef as domestic to get a government subsidy in connection with mad cow disease. 
	
	
 Snow Brand Food, listed on the Second Section, also shed 7 yen to 85 yen. 
	
	
 Mitsui Construction rose 1 yen to 46 yen after a daily newspaper said Wednesday that the company and Sumitomo Construction will soon begin negotiations on integrating their business operations, a report later denied by the companies. Sumitomo Construction ended unchanged. 
	
	
 Nomura Holdings lost 19 yen to 1,533 yen in the wake of a 79% dive in its group net profit in the April-December period from a year earlier. 
	
	
 The Second Section index shed 17.02 points to 1,675.10 on a volume of 7.06 million shares. In Osaka, the near-term March Nikkei 225 index futures contract advanced 40 points to 10,090.

Commentary by Nawab Khan in Brussels in the ""Perspective"" column: ""Hypocrisy Exposed"" 
	
	
 The so-called US-led campaign against terrorism is inspiring opportunistic attacks on civil liberties around the world, 'Human Rights Watch' warned in its annual global survey released recently. After the Sept. 11 attacks, the US gained worldwide sympathy and support which, however, evaporated quickly due to America's gross violations of international norms of behaviour. America is arresting foreign nationals in a foreign country (Afghanistan) locking them up in cages in another foreign country (Cuba) and all this without any international legitimacy. It is also continuing its bombings in Afghanistan although there is an interim government in place there now. The US is indeed setting a terrific example of how to violate international laws and human rights. The Human Rights Watch report said ""Imagine the US condemning military tribunals set up by a tin-pot tyrant to get rid of his political enemies. That kind of criticism can have real sting. But, now it will ring with hypocrisy."" In the US and western Europe, measures designed to combat terrorism are threatening long-held human rights principles. ""Terrorists believe that anything goes in the name of their cause"", said Kenneth Roth, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch. ""The fight against terror must not buy into that logic. Human rights principles must not be compromised in the name of any cause."" The anti-terrorism drive will not succeed if it is conducted merely as a struggle against a particularly ruthless set of criminals, Roth said. To defeat, the fundamental amorality of terrorism requires a firm grounding in international human rights. The willingness of most western governments to tolerate abuses by friendly governments in the Middle East and North Africa has tended to undermine the growth of a human rights culture there. The problem includes the West's failure to rein in Israeli abuses against Palestinians, its apparent disregard for grave civilian suffering caused by sanctions against Iraq; and its complete unwillingness to raise human rights issues with friendly governments in the Arab world.

As prisoners from Al-Qa'ida and Taliban are being transported to the cells of the US Guantanamo base in Cuba, the United States' war on terrorism enters a new stage that is completely different from that of armed confrontation in Afghanistan. 
	
	
 Amidst the heat of military battles in Afghanistan, and on the background of the double crime that hit the United States, international opinion is now willing to overlook some inhumane practices that were made on this or that front. However, the situation has changed fundamentally since the batches of Al-Qa'ida and Taliban prisoners started arriving one after the other to Guatanamo base shackled and caged in cages that are no longer than eight feet and wider than six. The attention of the world moved from Afghanistan to Cuba to follow what Amnesty International considers an ""uncomfortable situation"" for the detainees. This has prompted two of Washington's closest allies, Britain and Australia, to express their ""concern"" over the way the prisoners were transported from Afghanistan and the way they are being treated in captivity. 
	
	
 It is obvious that statements by US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld that the detainees are ""illegitimate fighters"" upon home the Geneva convention on POW's does not apply have not helped alleviate world concern over the US abandoning its (until now) well-known commitment to the principles of justice in treating the Al-Qa'ida and Taliban prisoners. 
	
	
 The continued US ambiguity in using the title of prisoners, and specifically prisoners of war or ""illegitimate"" combatants, and the possibility of trying them in private and closed martial court, do not help the United States maintain international sympathy with its war. 
	
	
 As the campaign of Western criticism of the United States heightens, it has become urgent for Washington to clarify its stand on treating the prisoners and their destiny so that it would not be recorded in history that the number one democracy in the war won the war on terrorism in weeks and lost the reputation of commitment to principles of human justice that it took centuries to gain.

LONDON, Jan 24 (AFP) -- British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said Thursday [24 January] it was ""far preferable"" that British prisoners held at the US Navy base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba should face justice in Britain. 
	
	
 Three Britons are among 158 captured al-Qa'ida and Taliban fighters detained at the camp. They were captured in Afghanistan during the US-led military campaign against the country's now-crumbled hardline Taliban regime. 
	
	
 ""It is far preferable if they are British citizens for them to come to the United Kingdom and face justice here,"" Straw told BBC radio. 
	
	
 He was speaking after American John Walker Lindh, captured while fighting for the Taliban, arrived handcuffed and shackled at Dulles International Airport outside the US capital late Wednesday and was taken to a nearby jail. 
	
	
 He faces trial in his own country on charges of conspiring to kill US nationals and supporting terrorist groups. 
	
	
 The US military put on hold transfers of prisoners to the Cuba base Wednesday. 
	
	
 International criticism of conditions at the makeshift camp have grown since the first detainees were transferred from Afghanistan earlier this month. 
	
	
 The prisoners are being held at the temporary outdoor detention facility called ""Camp X-Ray"" where each has a separate cell with a concrete floor, wooden roof and chain-link walls.

Stop the circus 
	
	
 1/24/02 1:26:16 AM (GMT +2) 
	
	
 A YEAR after gently attempting to nudge Zimbabwe's government into embracing minimum conditions that allow for a free and fair presidential election, several local and international groups find themselves back to square one, unable to move the Harare authorities even an inch. Several diplomatic missions from organisations such as the European Union (EU), the Commonwealth, the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) and Africa's powerhouse Nigeria have come and gone from Harare empty-handed. 
	
	
 So have been attempts by Zimbabwe's civic bodies such as the Crisis Group, the National Constitutional Assembly, well-meaning churches such as the Roman Catholics and even the so-called National Economic Consultative Forum. 
	
	
 In their own ways, these groups have sought dialogue rather than confrontation to prod President Robert Mugabe to see reason and put his nation first and not to embark on the suicidal path that he has chosen. 
	
	
 Predictably, their advice has fallen on stones because, whatever their suggestions, Mugabe could not care less, interested only in retaining power at any cost. 
	
	
 With the presidential election only a month away, all these organisations appear not only to have grown too tired of insisting on their initial demands, but of actually scaling them back, frustrated that no one is listening. 
	
	
 For example, most of these groups have long urged the formation of an independent electoral commission to take charge of the preparations and conduct of the ballot, but are now reluctantly willing to accommodate Mugabe's partisan Electoral Supervisory Commission. 
	
	
 These bodies have long called for the deployment of independent election observers, both Zimbabwean and international, and yet none are in place even a few weeks before the polls. 
	
	
 What is clear - if this was not so obvious all along to some of these organisations - is that nothing whatsoever will deter Mugabe from doing anything and everything to claim victory in the ballot, however fraudulent. 
	
	
 Therefore the time to stop this tragic circus - many would say madness - is either now or never. 
	
	
 For the EU and the Commonwealth, which are due to meet shortly, they should realise that they are running out of meaningful options to influence the course of events in Zimbabwe. 
	
	
 Even by the EU's own submissions just two weeks ago, its international observers - and not pliant ones handpicked by the government to validate a sham - should have been on the ground by now, but the 15-nation bloc is still talking to Harare! 
	
	
 What is the point of engaging in dialogue with a government that is only interested in buying time while it fervently escalates a campaign of bludgeoning its citizens in the hope of frightening voters into supporting Mugabe? 
	
	
 What is South African President Thabo Mbeki's point when he says the SADC must ensure that Zimbabwe has a free election when, as he knows, nothing practical is being done by the regional body to ensure that Mugabe indeed complies? Either the EU and the SADC - as indeed all others - take meaningful action now that will move the Harare authorities or they forever hold their peace. 
	
	
 For example, the EU and the SADC - as all others - must refuse to send observers if these are not allowed to be on the ground by the end of this week or early next week at the very latest. 
	
	
 It follows therefore that all these groups must reject in advance the fraud that is being staged under the guise of an election, unless Mugabe urgently meets all the minimum conditions that allow for a semblance of a free and fair ballot. 
	
	
 And as all must now know - Mbeki included - Mugabe has no chance at all of winning any ballot that is free from intimidation and violence, notwithstanding his desperate last-minute act to try to buy votes using the hurried land reforms.

KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 25 (AFP) -- Malaysia on Friday sent an official protest to the US embassy here over the ""inhumane"" treatment of Taliban and al-Qaeda detainees held at a US naval base in Cuba. 
	
	
 Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar was quoted by Bernama news agency as saying the detainees should be treated as prisoners of war according to international law. 
	
	
 ""We are not protesting the effort to fight terrorism but we feel that the Taliban and al-Qaeda detainees are war prisoners and they are subjected to the Geneva Convention,"" he said. 
	
	
 ""At the moment, treatment is rough and not in line with guidelines set under international law . . . their condition is not satisfactory and the treatment given to them is inhumane."" 
	
	
 The memorandum of protest came a day after Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad criticised the treatment of the detainees. 
	
	
 European nations have also criticized conditions at the US base after a US Department of Defense photograph showed a group of prisoners shackled, blindfolded, kneeling and wearing ear muffs. 
	
	
 US President George W. Bush has rejected charges of ill-treatment and was satisfied the military was upholding US traditions of humane treatment of prisoners while protecting the troops guarding them. 
	
	
 So far, 158 al-Qaeda and Taliban prisoners have been transferred from Afghanistan to the isolated Guantanamo base on Cuba's southeastern coast. Another 270 are being detained by the US military in or near Afghanistan.

KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 24 (Bernama) -- The Umno Supreme Council Thursday called on the Foreign Ministry to send a memorandum of protest to the United States (US) government over their treatment of Taliban prisoners which was described as inhumane. 
	
	
 Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who is also Umno president, said the party's Supreme Council meeting Thursday also took note of the treatment given by Washington on the 158 Taliban prisoners at X-Ray Camp which had also been criticised by human rights groups in the West. 
	
	
 ""The Supreme Council voiced its protest against the United States' handling of the captured Taliban soldiers who were detained in Cuba which the Supreme Council finds inhumane. 
	
	
 ""Thus, the Supreme Council calls on the Foreign Ministry to send a memo to the United States government,"" he said at a press conference after chairing the meeting at the Umno headquarters, here. 
	
	
 According to the report, the US Government had brought 158 prisoners from the US base in Kandahar, Afghanistan to the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, including 14 who arrived on Monday. 
	
	
 The inmates had typically been brought to Cuba in shackles and handcuffs, wearing blacked-out goggles, earmuffs and surgical masks to keep them from biting. 
	
	
 Meanwhile, Dr Mahathir said the Supreme Council meeting Thursday also discussed the dangers posed by the Kumpulan Militan Malaysia (KMM) activities which aimed to topple the government through violence. 
	
	
 ""We have enough evidence on their involvement in violent acts and their plans to use violence, as well as their connection with international terrorists,"" he said, stressing that the KMM had no confidence in the democratic system. 
	
	
 He said the government had identified many members of the group and action to detain those involved had been taken while investigations on the activities of other KMM members were still ongoing. 
	
	
 Dr Mahathir said the government had laws that prevented certain crimes from happening and allowed detention without trial. 
	
	
 However, court action would be taken if there were proofs that they had committed criminal acts, he said.

KABUL, Jan 25 (AFP) -- A 21-member commission to organise a special ""Loya Jirga"" tribal council to set Afghanistan on the path to elections was named here Friday during a historic visit by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. 
	
	
 At a joint news conference with Annan, interim Afghan leader Hamid Karzai read out the members of the commission, which he described as ""the most important task for the interim administration and for the United Nations"". 
	
	
 Annan, paying the first visit to Afghanistan by a UN chief in more than 40 years, acknowledged factional differences that had held up the naming of the group. 
	
	
 ""It wasn't easy to put the list together,"" Annan said, explaining the 21 names had been whittled down from a shortlist of 300. 
	
	
 ""I know that not everybody will be entirely happy with the list, but it is a good list and let's support them and work with them."" 
	
	
 The commission includes at least one woman, as vice chair, in line with the demand for female representation outlined in last month's Bonn accord which set up Karzai's interim authority. 
	
	
 ""We set out to get a group that would be independent, a group of men and women that would have integrity, who are highly respected within the society, to request them to help organise the Loya Jirga,"" Annan said. 
	
	
 The 21-member council must determine procedures and the number of people who will participate in the Loya Jirga, or traditional council of tribal elders. 
	
	
 The Bonn accord paved the way for the formation of a six-month power-sharing interim administration that took office in Kabul on December 22. 
	
	
 The Loya Jirga has to appoint a transitional authority that will rule the war-ravaged country in the lead-up to democratic elections, which must be held within two years. 
	
	
 The special commission is obliged to draft rules and procedures relating to the allocation of seats on the Loya Jirga for people in Afghanistan as well as for Afghan refugees living in Pakistan and Iran. 
	
	
 It also has to include representatives of Afghans who have left the country and settled abroad, as well as of civil society organisations and Islamic scholars, intellectuals and traders. 
	
	
 It must decide on rules and procedures for the convening of the Loya Jirga, as well as when and where it should meet, and for how long. 
	
	
 It also has to ensure that the process for indirect election or selection of members of the Loya Jirga is both transparent and fair. 
	
	
 Karzai reaffirmed his determination that the interim government would not interfere in the commission or Loya Jirga. 
	
	
 Annan said he hoped the commission members ""together with the UN will be successful in their work and give Afghanistan a fair Loya Jirga"".

Washington, January 26 (XINHUA) -- US Secretary of State Colin Powell has asked President George W. Bush to reverse the president's decision on al-Qa'ida and Taliban detainees and declare the terrorists as prisoners of war under the Geneva Convention, the Washington Times reported on Saturday. 
	
	
 A four-page internal White House memorandum obtained by the Washington Times shows that Powell made the request and that Bush' s National Security Council plans to meet on the matter Monday morning. 
	
	
 Bush decided on January 18 that hundreds of Taliban and members of Usama bin Ladin's al-Qa'ida army are detainees, and not prisoners of war, and thus not subject to rights in the Geneva Convention. 
	
	
 ""The secretary of state has requested that you reconsider that decision,"" White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales wrote in a memo to Bush. ""Specifically, he has asked that you conclude that GPW (Geneva Convention II on the Treatment of Prisoners of War) does apply to both al-Qa'ida and the Taliban fighters.""

AMMAN -- After months of low-profile activities, the 14 professional associations held their first anti-normalisation conference on Sunday during which they renewed calls for severing all ties with ""the Zionist enemy."" 
	
	
 More than 50 participants, most of them members of the unions' Anti-Normalisation Committee, took part in the one-day conference, held against a backdrop of uncertainty as to the future of the 10-year-old peace process. 
	
	
 The speakers outlined the plight of the Palestinians under occupation and the suffering of Iraqi people facing crippling international sanctions for the eleventh consecutive year. 
	
	
 They also lambasted ""US-British aggression on Iraq and meddling in its internal affairs."" 
	
	
 ""Normalisation with the Zionist enemy is a crime against the country, nation and humanity,"" read one of the banners hoisted at the Professional Associations Complex. 
	
	
 According to Council of Unions' president Mohammad Oran, the anti- normalisation drive remains an Arab, Muslim and human goal. It is also a binding decision taken by the professional associations' general assembly, after Jordan sealed a peace treaty with Israel in October 1994. 
	
	
 Former Hamas spokesperson Ibrahim Ghosheh and spokesperson for the Muslim Brotherhood Jamil Abu Baker took part in the conference. 
	
	
 Sunday's gathering is the first such public event since authorities cracked down early last year on the anti-normalisation committee after they made public a blacklist of Jordanians they claimed had established ""ties with the Jewish state."" 
	
	
 During Sunday's conference, nine papers were discussed. 
	
	
 Political affiliation among association members lean heavily towards Islamist, pan-Arab and leftist groups. 
	
	
 Conference participants warned against Israeli ""expansionist plans"" and argued that the peace treaty was in favour of the ""Zionist enemy."" 
	
	
 They called for ""ostracising"" those who deal with Israeli partners and maintaining a total boycott of the Jewish state at the grassroots level. 
	
	
 On the official level, relations between Jordan and Israel have been strained since the outbreak of the Intifada 16 months ago. Jordan has delayed sending its ambassador designate, Abdul Ilah Kurdi, to Tel Aviv. 
	
	
 The conference also honoured the families of Jordanian detainees in Israeli jails.

You can never be too sure about what you are communicating. Such could be the lesson drawn by the Pentagon and the White House from the hue and cry that has been provoked in the world by the release of the now famous photographs of blinded, gagged, chained, and kneeling prisoners in their enclosure at the Guantanamo camp. At the end of a brilliantly waged and very carefully framed war, punctuated by briefings that had brought Donald Rumsfeld, the Defense Secretary, a veritable media triumph, there was this one image too many. 
	
	
 In the commentaries of newspapers that were the most well disposed toward the United States ( The Daily Telegraph and The Times of London), in the very remarks by certain officials from the ""coalition,"" the reactions, quite particularly in Great Britain, the US's top ally in Afghanistan, have ranged from incomprehension to indignation, from slight confusion to high distress. ""Bush is quite close to pulling off the impossible: losing the sympathy of the civilized world for the United States,"" an astonished The Daily Mirror wrote. One must not confuse ""justice and vengeance,"" lest one lose one's ""moral advantage,"" European commissioner Chris Patten explained. Even certain US newspapers, led by The New York Times , have hinted at some doubts about the Pentagon's attitude. 
	
	
 ""Illegal Combatants"" 
	
	
 All this for a single photograph, something that, after all, was quite neat and tidy, in which men are seen dressed in gleaming suits and modern, civilized instruments of coercion (blinding eyeglasses, masks incapacitating the mouth and nose, ear-splitting ear phones)? It was a photograph taken by a US soldier and officially disseminated by the United States Navy on a Defense Department Internet site. So an edifying photograph, or viewed as such, but one which, the explanation is, in fact is deceiving: the prisoners were reportedly photographed shortly after their arrival, that is, if one understands this correctly, they were shackled and blinded as they had been during the 27-hour trip from Afghanistan to Cuba. But, however, they were under medical supervision, their heads shaved, and enjoying hygienic and food conditions that were very superior to what they could have known in Afghanistan. 
	
	
 One can imagine how Rumsfield, who is ordinarily so sure of himself and of his jokes, might have gone off his rocker once and, for an hour, could have ranted and raved against the ""hyperbole,"" the exaggeration that, according to him, marked the reactions generated by this photograph, and reminded the world about the degree to which the US attitude was ""humane, legal, and proper."" 
	
	
 This ""legal"" aspect of the debate is now quite well known: the prisoners taken on the ground are considered to be ""illegal combatants"" by the Americans and not prisoners of war. Only US officials know (or think they know) who these men are whose identities have not been made public: according to certain US media, the most ""important"" of the Guantanamo prisoners is reportedly the Taliban army's chief of general staff. That, in theory, would seem to make him a prisoner of war par excellence if Washington were now not confusing the Taliban regime (which the US has destroyed, but without declaring war on it) with Al-Qa'ida's terrorist network. The solidity of this argument, though, has increasingly been demolished, by, among others, the Red Cross, which thinks that, until proof (legally established) of the contrary, the prisoners should be considered prisoners of war. 
	
	
 Washington officials refuse this school of thought (which would lead them to refrain from interrogating the prisoners, indeed to release them after the end of the hostilities) but seem to be aware of the fact that here they are not on very solid legal ground. So Rumsfield stated that the prisoners' treatment was ""reasonably consistent"" with the Geneva Conventions, which was a way of saying, in this particular case, that the US was the only judge of what was ""reasonable."" That, however, is the problem. Just as is the fact that ""the"" US Al-Qa'ida fighter, John Walker Lindh, will not be shut up in one of the four square meter cages at Guantanamo but sent to a US prison and tried by a normal court. 
	
	
 The End and the Means 
	
	
 Since 11 September, the US has behaved as if it had a sort of natural right to create law. Because they had been the victims of terrorist attacks and, more deeply, because Americans are ""good,"" even if, as President Bush had explained, the world did not always realize ""how good they were."" Until now, this right-this right right, if one prefers-has more or less been accepted by Washington's partners. The distress generated by one photograph published inadvertently or through excess self-confidence might only mean that this consensus is in the process of eroding. And that the Europeans, in particular, are no longer quite ready to follow the Americans in their way of thinking. 
	
	
 But perhaps there is something else, deeper, more diffuse. Throughout this Afghan campaign, there have been some other slightly troubling images. Some real, concrete, like those of these fighters in rags, haggard, who were the survivors of weeks of bombing. Those of members of the US special forces, equipped with all their panopoly of soldiers of the future and, this arresting contrast, those of their ""auxiliaries"" from the Northern Alliance, barefoot, wearing sandals and in the snow, at the entrance to caves they were responsible for cleaning up. Other more virtual ones (because in this case the communication was better monitored) of Marines protected with surgical masks and gloves transporting prisoners chained to stretchers to planes, as journalists from the print media were able to see them using binoculars. There have also been, based more on intuition than on images, doubts about the match-up between the end and the means, and the admiration, mixed with fear, that an implacable force generates, that of US missiles and airplanes in action. 
	
	
 There is now, in a sort of provisional epilogue, this quasi-Orwellian image of totally dominated men deprived of the use of their senses. Big Brother, even democratically elected and at war against evil, is perforce a bit scary.

On 13 January, the leader of the Taiwanese authorities proudly announced at a gathering of pro-""Taiwan independence"" elements that beginning this year Taiwanese travel documents would have an addition of ""Taiwan"" in English. He claimed that this was a ""gift"" to ""Taiwan independence"" groups. This is another dangerous signal of the leader of the Taiwanese authorities promoting ""gradual Taiwan independence"" and an attempt to split the motherland. We should maintain sharp vigilance on this move. 
	
	
 The addition to passports is a move that the leader of the Taiwanese authorities has long premeditated, carefully planned, and gradually implemented. As early as in 2000, the Taiwanese authorities notified various departments, including the Taiwanese ""Foreign Ministry,"" to use the ""official"" symbol of Taiwan in name tags, seating plates, menus, guest books, writing paper and invitations, and avoid using the symbol of the ""national emblem."" Instead, they should replace it with the symbol of the ""national flat."" If it is absolutely not feasible, they should use the symbol of the ""plum blossom."" In May 2000, ""Taiwan independence"" activist Yao Jiawen claimed in Tokyo, Japan that the Taiwanese authorities instructed its ""Foreign Ministry"" to change the English translation of the ""People's Republic of China"" on passports to ""Taiwan,"" and name all overseas agencies ""Taiwanese"" agencies. This caused strong opposition from all the various aspects. The Taiwanese authorities had to respond in low key. On 19 June, leaders of the Taiwanese authorities met with ""legislators"" of the Democratic Progressive Party and expressed publicly for the first time that the addition of ""Taiwan"" in English on ""passports"" was ""imperative."" 
	
	
 We should notice that the addition to ""passports"" is not an isolated incident. Its harm is not limited to the incident itself, but lies in the fact that it is an important step for the Taiwanese authorities to promote its ""gradual Taiwan independence."" 
	
	
 The leader of the Taiwanese authorities once made the commitment of the so-called ""four noes and one will not"" when he took office in May 2000. The ""four noes"" are pledges ""not to declare independence, not to change the national title, not to push for 'state-to-state relations to be included in the constitution, and not to promote a referendum to change the status quo in regard to independence;"" and the one will not is ""will not abolish the guiding principle of national unification and the National Unification Commission."" However, one month later, he changed his tone and said that the ""92 consensus"" was a ""consensus"" without any consensus. In August, he preached again that ""unification is not necessarily the only and final choice."" In November, he manufactured the so-called ""three acknowledgements and four suggestions"" and then claimed that the two sides of the strait ""are not subordinated to each other, and do not represent each other."" In his 2001 New Year's speech, he proposed the ambiguous ""conformity theory,"" which takes the tone of unification but promotes independence in nature. In May 2001, he claimed that his ""conformity theory"" was not really for unification, nor it was for conformity."" 
	
	
 At the same time, the leader of the Taiwanese authorities gradually promoted the so-called ""correcting the name of Taiwan."" Recently, the Taiwan ""Press Bureau"" stopped using the symbol with the map of China. Taiwanese authorities concerned forced a Taiwanese NGO to change the word of ""China"" in its English annual. Now, the Taiwanese authorities wants to add the English word of ""Taiwan"" on Taiwanese travel documents. All these activities to ""change the name of Taiwan,"" along with the Taiwanese authorities' comprehensive policies of ""separating from China"" in ideology, culture, history, education and the media, are all attempts to separate Taiwan from China, and change its status as a part of China. The purpose is to create conditions for the final public announcement of ""Taiwan independence."" The development of these events fully indicates that the leader of the Taiwanese authorities has not only not given up his stance of ""Taiwan independence"" but also used the method of nibbling to promote ""gradual Taiwan independence."" 
	
	
 The promotion of ""gradual Taiwan independence"" by the leader of the Taiwanese authorities is from his misjudgment of two situations: the internal situation and the external situation. Internally, he considers the ""legislative"" election last year as the public's recognition to his idea of ""Taiwan independence."" Support from Lee Teng-hui and overseas ""Taiwan independence"" forces makes him believe that ""the situation is great."" In fact, the economic difficulties in the island, the political deadlock, and the public's confidence crisis should be the agenda for the Taiwanese authorities' top concern. Irresponsible promotion of ""Taiwan independence"" and intensification of cross-strait ties are definitely not blessings to Taiwan. Externally, Sino-US relations are increasingly improving. President Bush will visit China soon. The United States has made a commitment that it will not change its Taiwan policy. But the Taiwanese authorities exaggerated Sino-US conflicts and placed hopes on seeking benefits from such conflicts. This is really an unwise idea. 
	
	
 It is worth special attention that the mainland's stance on the Taiwan issue is very clear and has never changed. Taiwan is an inseparable part of China. Any type of ""Taiwan independence"" is absolutely not permitted. The mainland has the greatest sincerity of peaceful unification with Taiwan, and also strong determination and necessary preparations for preventing ""Taiwan independence"" and all separatist activities. If the Taiwanese authorities cling obstinately to its course and continue its steps of ""gradual Taiwan independence,"" they will only intensify cross-strait relations and will certainly eat their own bitter fruit.

 Space remains a Russian national priority. During a visit yesterday [21 January] to the Khrunichev State Space Scientific Production Center Vladimir Putin said that ""Russia will not be able lay claim to a worthy place in the civilized world"" or ensure its own defense capability if it abandons its space programs. In order to avoid any misinterpretation, the president let it be understood that the Kremlin is full of resolve to maintain both Russia's place in the civilized world and its defense capability at the proper level. After this, the center's general director, Aleksandr Medvedev, said that Mr. Putin ""is devoting significantly more time to cosmonautics than any of the country's previous leaders"" and for this showed him examples of the space-rocket equipment produced at the enterprise. 
	
	
 Vladimir Putin's visit to the Khrunichev center proved to be not only instructive but also very pleasant for the Russian president. Unlike the vast majority of the former giants of Russian industry, the center is an entirely successful enterprise now too. It is one of the most successful space-rocket firms not only by Russian criteria but by world ones too. The size of the center's hard-currency earnings since its foundation in 1993 is nearing $2 billion on commercial space-device launches alone and the center's annual budget exceeds three billion rubles. The Proton family of rockets the Khrunichev center produces is one of the most popular commodities on the international market for the launch of heavy carriers. The center is responsible for implementing the main programs connected with Russia's participation in the International Space Station (ISS) project. 
	
	
 Finally, the center is connected with the most promising space programs, which envisage the creation of an completely new family of Angara carrier rockets, the first of which should launch from the Russian Plesetsk space center next year. Incidentally, the money earned by the Khrunichev center has given serious support to the existence of Russia's main space center in recent years. These funds allowed the Plesetsk launch pad, which was built in Soviet times to launch the Ukrainian Zenit carrier rockets, to begin to be re-equipped for the upcoming Angara and as well as the establishment of an entire ground infrastructure for launching light Rokot space carriers, remodeled from SS-19 ballistic combat missiles. 
	
	
 Even though this was the first time Vladimir Putin had visited the center, people at the Khrunichev firm have considered him their ""godfather"" since last January when the president confirmed the center's current general director, Mr. Medvedev, in his position. After the center's previous head, Anatoliy Kiselev, resigned ""for health reasons,"" the enterprise had almost been headed by former Rosvooruzheniye Head Aleksey Ogarev, who is bound by good relations to Boris Yeltsin's family. But Putin vetoed it at the last minute -- by law, the center's general director is appointed by the president personally. 
	
	
 Vladimir Putin was insistently asked to tackle another of Russia's space problems yesterday. According to Rosaviakosmos Head Yuriy Koptev, he and his colleagues had ""informed the president"" of their wish that the program for the development of the Plesetsk space center be given federal status. In the future, Russia is planning to gradually transfer all launches from Kazakhstan's Baykonur onto its own territory. This is connected both with considerations of economy ($115 million has to be paid every year just to lease Baykonur) and with the problem of the country's ""space sovereignty"": After all it is only possible to guarantee to ensure the launches of commercial devices from your own territory. Incidentally, the president was reminded about ""space sovereignty"" on Monday before his visit to the center. During the talks with his Turkmen colleague that took place immediately before it, the head of state had to discuss an agreement to pay Ashgabat financial compensation for the use of so-called ""fall sites"": Three Turkmen regions (with a total area of over one million hectares) on which the spent rocket stages fall after being launched from Baykonur (the stipulated size of payment for a single use of the regions comes to around $70,000).

The dismissal in Venezuela of Minister of Interior and Justice Luis Miquilena, who up to that point had been the central figure in the process that put Hugo Chavez in power, again triggers the red light in those countries which, like Argentina and Colombia, border on Brazil. Dramatic things may be happening in the Venezuelan situation, and it is more than time for Brazilian diplomats to take notice of South American necessities. 
	
	
 It has long been known that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has influence on Chavez, who has asked him for advice more than once. The US Government itself considers him a kind of link for dealing with the situation in Venezuela. That situation has changed considerably since Chavez issued, by decree, a package of 49 laws of a nationalizing character. Those laws affect almost everything in the country, from petroleum to land ownership. Shortly after that, on the occasion of the attack on the twin towers in New York, Chavez said that the US reaction to Taliban terrorism was also a terrorist act, thereby straining his relations with Washington. 
	
	
 Chavez' short but tumultuous time in power, which he achieved by electoral means following a failed mutiny, arouses fears concerning the future of Latin America's oldest democracy. From election to election and plebiscite to plebiscite, Venezuela is moving rapidly toward a ""legal coup"" that may be the logical consequence of the clashes inside Miraflores Palace. 
	
	
 While on the outside the population expresses its discontent with resounding pots-and-pans demonstrations, cracks are appearing inside the government among the 13 parties that supported Chavez in his rise to political power. It was to be expected that the new laws--a consequence of the economic crisis--would have different effects on the union leaders, radical left-wing politicians, and populist militants represented in the government. Bad government management complicates any situation. 
	
	
 The changes made by Chavez in his team expose the cracks in the coalition. In response to the reaction in the street, the radical wing opposes any agreement with opposition groups. The moderate wing supports dialogue with the opposition to try to reduce political tension. As the opposition raises its head, the climate of plots takes shape. The noise from the pots and pans does a poor job of hiding the opposition's desire to launch a kind of civil disobedience, an indication that Venezuela has finally entered a dangerous stage. 
	
	
 Venezuela's economic situation forms a wretched background for the ideological experiments of the Bolivarian Constitution that Chavez got approved by plebiscite. The worst recession in recent decades has been alleviated only by the recent increase in petroleum prices. Eight hundred firms have closed their doors. Half the active population is in the informal economy. All of that stands in brutal contrast to the 1970's, the decade of the petroleum boom, when Andres Perez was the ""socialist Little Father."" Over $200 billion in royalties was squandered with no benefit at all for the population. When the price of petroleum fell the first time, the Venezuelan economy went down the drain. 
	
	
 The electoral path followed by Chavez when his attempt at an open coup failed may now be the aperitif for the probable ""democratic coup"" that is being prepared from the inside out.

Poll observers invited 
	
	
 Presidential Reporter - PRESIDENT Mugabe yesterday invited foreign observers from various international organisations and some individual countries to come and observe the forthcoming Presidential election but will not allow observers from Britain. 
	
	
 Cde Mugabe told journalists at State House in Harare that the joint ACP/European Union and Commonwealth teams, which have been invited to observe the March 9 and 10 presidential election should not include Britain, which has been accused of interfering in the internal politics of Zimbabwe. 
	
	
 ""In line with Zimbabwe's tradition of holding open democratic elections, my Government will be inviting, among others, the following organisations and governments to send observers to witness the electoral process and see the people of Zimbabwe proudly exercise their sovereign right to freely elect a President of their choice: 
	
	
 ""The Organisation of African Unity/Africa Union (OAU/AU); the Southern Africa Development Community (Sadc); the Common Market for East and Southern Africa (Comesa); the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas); the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM); the Commonwealth, excluding the United Kingdom; the joint ACP-EU delegation (excluding the United Kingdom) and led by the ACP; the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP) from the United States of America; individuals and countries to be invited in their own capacities include the Federal Republic of Nigeria,'' he said. 
	
	
 Sadc and Nigeria will be invited to send their observers immediately. 
	
	
 The President also appealed to all political parties, churches, war veterans, farmers' unions, trade unions, business associations, media houses, women and youth organisations and civic society to come together and exchange views on ending political violence. 
	
	
 He said this would create an atmosphere conducive to the holding of a free, fair and peaceful election. 
	
	
 Cde Mugabe said the Government would do everything necessary to ensure the holding of a free and fair election, as it had done during all the previous elections conducted in the country since the attainment of independence in 1980. 
	
	
 Although the President did not say why the United Kingdom, the former colonial power was not welcome to send observers, relations between Zimbabwe and Britain have soured over London's interference in Harare's internal affairs through its sponsorship to the opposition MDC party. 
	
	
 The Government has accused Britain of being a player in Zimbabwe's internal politics, saying it would therefore not be an impartial observer. 
	
	
 Britain has of late been at the forefront in calling for sanctions against Zimbabwe through the EU and the suspension of the country from the Commonwealth. 
	
	
 Cde Mugabe said recalling the supreme sacrifice paid by Zimbabweans in their struggle for self-determination and the pride they take in exercising their sovereign right to elect a President of their choice, the Government would do everything necessary to ensure that they exercise their democratic right without interference from any quarter whatsoever, whether internal or external. 
	
	
 ""My Government will, as is its practice, be accrediting foreign journalists through our embassies to cover the forthcoming election on the basis of the country's laws and regulations."" 
	
	
 Since he announced the dates for the Presidential election on January 9, the Government had taken steps and set on course various processes to facilitate the holding of a smooth electoral process. 
	
	
 Cde Mugabe expressed satisfaction with the Government's preparations for the election so far. 
	
	
 The election, he said, will once again underline Zimbabwe's established democratic tradition of holding regular parliamentary and presidential elections since the attainment of independence as provided for by its Constitution. 
	
	
 Cde Mugabe said the poll would be held in the same way the Government has held other elections since 1980 despite statements by some Western governments that it will not be free and fair. 
	
	
 ""In West Africa, they say make you no mind"" (do not mind them). We will proceed with our election in the same way as we have proceeded. I do not remember any election at all when their pronouncements were fair?"" 
	
	
 Cde Mugabe said there could never be any election anywhere in the world without any incident. He cited as an example the case of British deputy Prime Minister, Mr Prescott, who punched a protester who had hit him with an egg in the run up to the general elections in Britain last year. 
	
	
 The EU was demonising Zimbabwe despite the fact that the country had a tradition of regular and democratic elections. 
	
	
 On the other hand, the union was quick to enter into alliances with countries such as Uganda and Rwanda, which had no tradition of democratic polls. The same countries had also violated international law by invading the DRC. 
	
	
 Asked about his chances in the poll, Cde Mugabe said he was representing a party that had seen years of experience and had won parliamentary and presidential elections before. 
	
	
 ""We know how to campaign, we know how to appeal to our people...we know how to improve the lot of our people, we know what we have planned for our people for the present situation, we know what we have planned for them for the future,"" he said.

If the attack on the World Trade Centre was intended to be a warning to America to abandon its anti-Arab policies, the warning was not heeded. The attacks have accomplished for the Bush administration and Israel what no political or social force within America has ever been able to accomplish in recent memory. The attacks have been a great gift to pro-Israel groups in America, as well as Israel. The notion of a right-wing Zionist state ardently propelled by right-wing America is a dream come true for pro-Israel groups. 
	
	
 Soon after the World Trade Centre attacks, we started to witness the beginning of a concerted effort by the Bush administration and the media to cast Arabs and Muslims as the new enemy of America. The campaign has been successful so far, and has not been seriously challenged by Arab and Muslim Americans who have been struggling to merely distance themselves from terrorism. The early signs of the newly-shaped American perception of their conflict with Arabs and Muslims have started to surface. Complete disregard for the plight of the Palestinians despite timid warnings to Israel to show restraint is indicative of the new political perspective. 
	
	
 Indeed, American foreign policy towards the Arab and Muslim worlds was not much better before Sept. 11, but since then tactful political manoeuvring has given way to forthright disregard for the Arab viewpoint. This is only the beginning of a new Arab-American relationship. Although it is difficult to imagine that the American foreign policy towards Arab issues could become worse than what it has been, my sense is that it will be much more difficult to argue the Arab viewpoint in the American decision-making quarters. Whatever little leverage the Arab countries used to have to moderate the American foreign policy bias has but disappeared. 
	
	
 The attack on the World Trade Centre was particularly disheartening to a fledgling Arab and Muslim American community that had made a tremendous amount of progress in introducing Arabs and Muslims as legitimate political constituents on the American political scene. It was once hoped that a well-organised Arab and Muslim community in the United States could curb the attacks on Arabs and Muslims in the media and start to do what Arab and Muslim governments had not done by injecting the Arab viewpoint into the American political discourse. 
	
	
 As bad as the prospects of change seem to be at this juncture, I don't believe fresh efforts are doomed to failure. There is need for a partnership between Arab and Muslim governments and existing Arab and Muslim communities in the United States to counterbalance the anti-Arab and anti-Muslim forces in America. 
	
	
 The American society is a dynamic, changing one that can be swayed if presented with the right message on a consistent basis. Since the attacks, I have had a chance to speak to many Americans who have no grasp of the Arab viewpoint. I have to say that Americans are not innately biased against Arabs and Muslims. Many people here are not happy with the influence that small pressure groups have on their foreign policy. Many people are enthusiastic about a new Arab-American relationship that is based on mutual respect and understanding. 
	
	
 A strong case can be made for change in the American foreign policy at the grassroots level. However, like any other legitimate message, it costs money, sustained effort, and organisation to put it out. The Arab and Muslim communities in the United States have made a great progress without considerable support from the Arab and Muslim governments. I believe much more can be accomplished if closer attention is paid to the potential for change from within America. Supporting our schools and community centres is a good starting point.

Cuito, 25 Jan (Angop)- A road convoy which came in from Benguela Province carrying 1,500 metric tons of assorted goods arrived in the city of Cuito, the capital of Bie Province, on Tuesday [22 Jan]. The aim of this aid is to reduce the shortages faced by local population. 
	
	
 According to convoy chief Eusebio da Silva Ferreira, the convoy included 35 trucks, and it ferried 720 metric tons of corn, 623 metric tons of peas, and 157 metric tons of beans. He added that the above mentioned products will help offset the difficult social conditions of more than 460,000 people in need in the province. 
	
	
 These aid goods have arrived at a time when the World Food Program, WFP is cutting down on air transportation of aid to Bie Province from 3,500 metric tons to 2,000 metric tons. This is because of the high costs involved, and the poor conditions of the local landing strip. Because of these problems, the WFP has not been able to provide all the necessary assistance to people in need, who are estimated to total more than 460,000.

On Monday 28 January, the US National Security Council convened for an uncomfortable meeting; the main issue to be debated was known as early as the week before, following an unprecedented split that had emerged in the US Administration. These were some of the leaders called to express their opinions: Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Vice President Dick Cheney, John Ashcroft (general prosecutor and chief of the Justice Department), CIA Director George Tenet, General Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and others. President George W. Bush and Secretary of State Colin Powell also participated in this business. 
	
	
 The issue at stake was apparently simple: the status of the detainees, members of al-Qa'ida and Taliban fighters captured by US troops in Afghanistan in recent months and recently transferred to a detention base at Guantanamo Bay. Eventually, President Bush agreed to reconsider some of the decisions he had announced a short time previously. In other words, he admitted he had been wrong -- and that at time when opinion polls in the United States are, without exception, very favorable to him. 
	
	
 This is about the following: on 18 January 2002, President Bush publicly announced two decisions, which, owing to the President's firmness in announcing them, seemed unyielding: first, the President said the 158 pro-Taliban fighters brought to Guantanamo Bay were not defined by US courts as prisoners of war; therefore, the United States does not believe it is its duty to grant them prisoner-of-war rights under the Geneva Convention, which regulates (since 1949) the status of this category of detained combatants. In the actual situation we are discussing, the issue is the privileges ensured by the Convention: according to that act, no detained combatant can be forced to reveal to the interrogator anything other than his name, rank, military serial number, and birth date. And, most of all -- this is a very important detail in this case -- the Convention forces the country that holds prisoners of war to release them immediately when the conflict is over. 
	
	
 In all likelihood, President Bush made that statement on 18 January following a consultation -- which was ""rather brief,"" some US observers believe -- with Ashcroft, who was strongly supported by Cheney. Obviously, this decision simplified things, and it allowed the US judiciary to conduct the investigation of the 158 detainees as it sees fit. The United States wanted this very much, because so far the identity and citizenship of those they call ""terrorists"" (or ""killers"" in Bush's languages without nuances) rather than prisoners in a conventional war have not been published for reasons that are easy to understand. According to information circulated by the main US newspapers, the detainees are citizens of 25 countries, including England, France, Australia, Yemen, Algeria, and even Sweden (!). Saudi Arabia alone says ""more than 100"" of the 158 are Saudi citizens (a figure the Americans see as exaggerated), and Saudi Interior Minister Prince Saud Nayif recently said that his country would like to have them repatriated, to be tried at home. 
	
	
 The surprise -- for the US administration and the US media -- came with a statement made by Powell. Following his recent world tours, Powell suggested that the President accept the validity of the Geneva Convention for the pro-Taliban detainees. According to his own assertions, the obvious concern of some Western European leaders -- US allies -- and of some important European governmental and non-governmental institutions about the treatment the detainees are being subjected to, especially following the publication of certain images of the Guantanamo Bay camp that could be interpreted in various ways, played a key role in this position. Sometimes the criticism was unexpectedly tough: Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, said ""the US Government cannot choose to wage war in Afghanistan with guns, bombs and soldiers, and then assert the laws of war do not apply."" Therefore, even if Powell agrees with the refusal to grant prisoner-of-war status to the 158 captives, he believe that the US refusal to cover the captives under the Geneva Convention would set a precedent that could affect the fate of US soldiers sent out to risky areas of this planet. In a first phase, the rest of the administration was baffled by Powell's opinion, but shortly afterward Rumsfeld sided with him, supporting his proposal in front of the President. According to interpretations on which the individual in question refused to comment, Condoleezza Rice, the US President's national security adviser, played an important role in supporting Powell's opinion. 
	
	
 Therefore, the dispute of opinions in the administration became a lesson in applied democracy. Eventually, making a sum of the proposals offered by his main advisers, President Bush admitted on Monday, following the National Security Council meeting, that the captives at Guantanamo Bay will be covered under the ""spirit of the Geneva Convention,"" even if their special status comes from the fact that they will continue to be designated terrorists, rather than prisoners of war. As for their possible repatriation, it cannot be taken into consideration, as long as the war against terrorism is far from over. 
	
	
 The fact that the President reconsidered his own statement of 18 January led to diverse reactions. There is irony -- including from the sober The New York Times , which wrote in its Tuesday issue that in his Monday speech the President ""twice called the 158 pro-Taliban fighters 'prisoners,' then stopped himself, and used the word 'detainees.'"" At first sight, this seems to be nothing more than a terminology issue. However, I believe it is more than that. In this concern about details -- about cold-blood accomplices to murder, because that is what these al-Qa'ida disciples at Guantanamo Bay are -- the US Administration proves it is capable of admitting it is not infallible, which is the equivalent of respect for democracy. And, as a last detail, let us remember that, harassed everywhere by journalists and commentators, no US leader ever thought of finding ""monkeys"" [reference to a statement made by Romanian Prime Minister Adrian Nastase] among media workers or scapegoats among the weirdoes who use hundreds of websites to call on the administration to stop supporting the Jews or to exterminate the Arabs.

'Club, EU attempting to perpetuate colonial relationship' 
	
	
 Herald Reporter - THE Government yesterday lambasted the Commonwealth and the European Union for attempting to perpetuate a colonial relationship between Europe and Africa. 
	
	
 In his opening address to a Southern Africa Development Community land task force on Zimbabwe, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Cde Stan Mudenge, said Zimbabwe was tired of being dictated to by the EU and the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group instead of being engaged in dialogue. 
	
	
 ""The Zimbabwe Government has no mandate from the free and proud people of Zimbabwe to return this country to a colonial or neo-colonial status. 
	
	
 ""Too much blood was shed and much suffering endured to achieve our independence and regain our sovereignty for anyone to imagine that they can either dictate or intimidate us into submission,"" said Cde Mudenge. 
	
	
 Soon after the meeting, the ministers said Sadc would not accept or participate in any form of sanctions on Zimbabwe by the EU or Commonwealth. 
	
	
 ""There are different forms of sanctions being talked about. Sadc will not participate in what ever form the sanctions may take,"" said taskforce chairperson Ms Lilian Patel, who is also Malawi Foreign Minister. 
	
	
 The EU has indicated that it would issue sanctions targeted at a few Government and Zanu-PF officials. 
	
	
 Cde Mudenge told the meeting that while Zimbabwe was addressing issues being raised by the two organisations, the two had not done anything to address issues raised by Zimbabwe. 
	
	
 Instead, they have issued ultimatums and some of the countries have imposed unofficial sanctions, which stood in the way of honest negotiations. 
	
	
 The minister said complying with some of their demands was like giving away the country to its former colonial masters. 
	
	
 The meeting by the Foreign ministers was a follow up to issues that were raised at the recent heads of state and government summit in Malawi. 
	
	
 Ms Lilian Patel said the situation in Zimbabwe required a more mature approach. 
	
	
 ""We in Sadc believe that the situation in Zimbabwe does not only require a careful and mature approach but also mutual understanding and patience because of its complexity,"" said Ms Patel. 
	
	
 She said the taskforce believed that constructive political dialogue was the key way forward to solving problems in Zimbabwe. 
	
	
 The taskforce was also of the view that the international media should be allowed to cover the country's Presidential election, an issue, which has already been resolved by Government. 
	
	
 Cde Mudenge said since the Malawi summit, the Government had taken a number of initiatives to implement most of the decisions in relation to Zimbabwe. 
	
	
 He said the Electoral Supervisory Commission had already identified trainers of monitors. 
	
	
 A countrywide voter education programme had been launched and was currently underway. 
	
	
 The Government had also asked the ESC to co-ordinate the drafting of a code of conduct in consultation with political parties intending to contest the Presidential election. 
	
	
 The process of inviting international observers started a week ago and was continuing. 
	
	
 ""Members of the Ministerial Committee will be fully briefed on the actions that are being taken to deal with the problem of violence which has taken place in some parts of the country,"" said Cde Mudenge. 
	
	
 The ministers will also have a chance to visit an area where political violence has been reported. 
	
	
 Cde Mudenge said the Government and the ruling party had launched campaigns against political violence. 
	
	
 President Mugabe would also soon be inviting all political parties, chiefs, churches, war veterans, media houses and civic organisations to a meeting on charting a peaceful way forward by finding ways of curtailing the incidents of violence. 
	
	
 ""The Government continues to uphold the freedom of expression and there are no cases of anyone being tried or having been held in custody for expressing his or her own opinion since the Blantyre Summit."" 
	
	
 Cde Mudenge said the judiciary had remained free as shown by two cases, which were won by opposition MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai and the Combined Harare Residents Association. 
	
	
 Meanwhile, the Sadc forum said yesterday that it will send at least 39 observers to Zimbabwe a month before the Presidential election. 
	
	
 ""We have been assured by the Zimbabwe Government that a formal invitation is coming, and we have set up a team of not less than 39 members who shall observe in the 10 provinces which have about 4,500 poling stations,"" the chairman of Sadc's Parliamentary forum Mr Sam Mpasu told AFP in Blantyre yesterday. 
	
	
 The observers will be drawn from members of Parliament in the 14-member nations, Mr Mpasu said. 
	
	
 The decision to send the observers was reached in Harare after a one-day meeting of the forum last week, Mpasu said. 
	
	
 The team will arrive in Zimbabwe a month before the crucial March 9 to 10 election, he added. 
	
	
 President Mugabe on Monday said the Sadc was among the groups he had invited to send observers to the polls. 
	
	
 The invited groups comprise mainly African nations, and explicitly exclude Britain, the former colonial power, which has spearheaded criticism of the Zimbabwe Government. 
	
	
 Sources in South Africa, a Sadc member, said earlier that Pretoria would send its own observers to the election, separate from the Sadc team, although President Mugabe did not invite South Africa in his statement on Monday. 
	
	
 The only nation specifically invited to send observers was Nigeria. 
	
	
 Sadc comprises Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia, Tanzania, Lesotho, Seychelles, Swaziland, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

Members of the US Congress and their guests have applauded 70 times during President George Bush's Annual State of the Union speech. In his address, Bush changed the warning from the ""evil empire"", the term used by former President Ronald Reagan to describe the Soviet Union and communism, to the ""access of evil"", the United States' new enemy. This enemy comprises several nations and terrorist organizations. Bush specifically named North Korea, Iran, and Iraq, countries that were formerly referred to as pariah and evil nations. It seems that the definition of the term pariah nations is the obstacle that prohibits or prevents the free world from imposing sanctions on them. 
	
	
 President Bush used his speech to give details about what the September terrorist operations have revealed. It now transpires that we are living in a world threatened by tens of thousands of terrorists and that more are on the way. They are now getting trained in terrorist camps that are scattered in scores of nations. 
	
	
 In his speech, President Bush upped the intensity of the US military-political rhetoric but kept things vague regarding his administration's policy on Iraq or the future of ties with North Korea. President Bill Clinton's administration tried to encourage rapprochement between the two Koreas. 
	
	
 The striking thing was the reference to Iran. A week ago President Bush warned Iran against obstructing stability in Afghanistan. By mentioning it in his speech, Bush has affirmed that his administration is thinking of a way to deal with it. Although it is one of many countries surrounding Afghanistan, Iran has an effective role to play in that country. 
	
	
 Some were surprised by President Bush's repeated reference to Iran as among the countries that make the ""access of evil."" This is because following the September operations there were some hints suggesting that Washington was viewing Iran from a new angle. 
	
	
 What might have changed the Bush administration's position are the mixed signals coming out of Iran, which represent a true reflection of the internal political climate in that country. For years the political groups within the Iranian authority have been speaking with different voices. 
	
	
 As regards Iraq, despite the hints of war in President Bush's speech there were other hints suggesting that he might resort to other means to achieve his goal, such as economic pressure, diplomatic isolation, total boycott, limited military operations, and support for the opposition groups. 
	
	
 There was a smell of danger in President Bush's speech and it was clear in the United States' decision to adopt a tough policy. By reviewing the scattered cases of terrorism, Bush has turned the world into a single front against terrorism and against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It is as if he returned the world to the Cold War era, when the US foreign policy was driven by the notion of anti-communism. The problem is that many mistakes were committed then, and they were serious mistakes, in the name of this policy. It is feared now that the fight against terrorism might be a cover for other goals. 
	
	
 Because the speech was about the State of the Union, President Bush seemed like he was underlining the ""unilateral"" role of the United States, thus dropping the coalition against terrorism. It is important to recall that the entire world that came out in protest against the September 11th attacks urged Washington to coordinate with its partners and allies. 
	
	
 In the wake of the Bush speech, the questions that arise are: How will the US administration reconcile between the domestic pressure to take action in the world on its own and other pressure to consult with its allies and friends in the world before embarking on any action? Bush has talked about some goals without telling us about the means that he will use to achieve them. One of these goals is how to prevent terrorists and countries that seek to acquire weapons of mass destruction from threatening the United States and the world. Another goal is to prevent countries that support terrorism from threatening the United States and its allies with weapons of mass destruction and terrorism. 
	
	
 The important thing is that the firmness that was apparent in Bush's speech means that the world should take seriously the possibility that the United States might achieve these goals.

Washington -- If this is a man... Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld calls the treatment of the prisoners captured in Afghanistan and shut away in the US base at Guantanamo Bay on the island of Cuba, ""humane."" But the concentration camp strongly resembles a dog pound, and no one would want his dog to be treated like that. 
	
	
 There are no cells or even shacks; there are just cages measuring 1.5 mt. by 2 mt. and just over 2 mt. high. Only the corrugated iron roof provides a little shade. The walls, if that is what you can call them, are made of wire fencing. The prisoners shelter as best they can from the heat, which never goes below the 30 degree Celsius mark even in winter. The sharp shooters posted on the turrets and the patrols that tour the camp with their Alsatian dogs never lose sight of the prisoners: not even when the latter attempt to catch some sleep on the 5 cm. thick foam rubber mattresses or when they use the sanitary bucket. That may be the reason why the camp, which stands segregated from the military base proper, has been called Camp X-Ray. Everything is visible, just like with an x-ray. 
	
	
 ""The accusations of ill treatment,"" Secretary Rumsfeld said, ""are completely untrue. What is taking place in Guantanamo is reasonable, humane, legal, proper, and compatible with the Geneva Convention on prisoners of war."" On which topic, incidentally, the US Government does not recognize the Taliban combatants that fell into its hands in Afghanistan as prisoners of war. A federal judge has agreed to examine an appeal made by human rights associations that are demanding that the prisoners be granted a regular trial. 
	
	
 The base in Guantanamo Bay was chosen for two reasons. It was chosen first and foremost because it is not US territory and thus no claim can be laid to the rights that the US Constitution guarantees to all prisoners, including foreigners. And second, you can only get into or out of the base on board a US Armed Forces helicopter. Thus not only is it impossible to escape, but the humanitarian associations could never organize a protest rally in such a place. 
	
	
 No Pig Meat -- Well, Actually, No Meat at All 
	
	
 The prisoners emerge from their cages only to take a shower, to go for a medical, or to take their short daily walk. They move around with a chain on one foot, and each one of them is watched over by fully two marines. They have all had their hair and beards shaved completely off, among other things also for reasons of hygiene. 
	
	
 Secretary Rumsfeld stressed with pride that the food rations provided are compatible with the tenets of the Muslim faith. In other words: no pig meat or meat from animals from which all the blood has not been fully removed. In actual fact, none of the witnesses that have visited the camp has ever seen any meat at all. The diet is based on beans, on rice, on cabbage, on bread, and on milk. 
	
	
 On the eastern side of the camp there is a sign in Arabic bearing the legend ""Qibla."" That is the word used to point in the direction of Mecca, toward which every Muslim is obliged to turn when praying. This is another of the ""privileges"" mentioned by Rumsfeld. The Secretary of Defense said reassuringly that the ""camp offers them hot showers, toilets, clean clothing, blankets, regular food, and the right to practice their faith."" The clothing in question is an orange training suit, identical for all the prisoners. There were toilets, but only for the guards; however, improvements are reportedly now being made in connection with the sanitary arrangements. 
	
	
 On 23 January, when there were 158 prisoners in Guantanamo, the airlift from Afghanistan was suspended. ""There is virtually no more room; work needs to be done on making the place bigger and better,"" a Department of Defense spokesman announced. For his part, Rumsfeld stressed that international protests ""have not been a factor"" in reaching this decision. 
	
	
 ""War is war..."" 
	
	
 Out of all the United States' European allies, only British Prime Minister Tony Blair has said that he subscribes to the US Government's decisions. ""War is war,"" he wrote in a letter to French daily Le Monde , ""and the safeguarding of human rights is clearly not the Pentagon's foremost concern, but Europe must shoulder this task."" The New York Times and the Washington Post , after dithering for a few days, have now been saying in their editorials that a democracy must show itself to be such also by the way in which it treats terrorists. 
	
	
 Los Angeles Federal Judge Howard Maz has given the government until 31 January to submit a memorandum in its defense against the charges being leveled at it by the human rights associations. The accusers, in their turn, have until 14 February to respond to that memorandum. But the judge himself has confessed to harboring serious doubts as to his jurisdiction in the affair. 
	
	
 Johnny Walker, the US citizen who was fighting with the Taliban in Afghanistan against his own compatriots, has not been subjected to the same fate as the other prisoners. He has been taken to a jail close to Washington. He is to be tried by a civil court. He knows the charges that have been made against him and he is being assisted by a defense team. The Saudi Arabian media have been quick to pick up on the difference of treatment that he has been granted. 
	
	
 The US Constitution appears not to apply to the Arabs in the concentration camp in Guantanamo. And in any case, it did not apply even to black people held in jail in the southern United States until a few years ago. In her book ""Beloved"" which won the Pulitzer prize back in 1988, writer Tony Morrison describes conditions far worse than those prevailing in Camp X-Ray. But also back then there were people who maintained that the treatment was almost overly humane.

Foreign Minister Celso Lafer transmitted a warning to United States Secretary of State Colin Powell, with whom he spent 30 minutes yesterday, from the Brazilian Government: without help from the US, Argentina could enter a state of social rebellion and open a new front of geopolitical instability in South America. Powell's reaction, according to a Planalto source, was one of ""interest and attention"". No more than that. The Brazilian Government's perception of Argentina's future is pessimistic. ""Their economic agenda alone is overwhelming,"" the source commented. It requires the creation of a Central Bank capable of administering a floating exchange rate system and a regime of inflation goals; the establishment of a safety network for the debilitated financial system; the restructuring of the tax policy, and the elaboration of a law that ensures fiscal discipline. Without US help, via the IMF, the country will not be able to attain the most basic economic, social and political stability, and could contaminate the subcontinent, Lafer warned. 
	
	
 [passage omitted] 
	
	
 ""La plata"" or social rebellion 
	
	
 Foreign Minister Celso Lafer carried a dramatic warning from President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to the US Government. In his conversation with Secretary of State Colin Powell, the Brazilian Foreign Minister stated clearly that to leave Argentina to its own fate, as seems to be the George Bush administration's choice, is to pave the way for social rebellion there, which will contaminate other countries on the continent and create another area of political instability on the planet. 
	
	
 The Argentina theme was also covered in Lafer's talks yesterday with Commerce Secretary Don Evans and with US Trade Representative Robert Zoellick. According to a Planalto Palace source, the reaction from Powell as well as from Evans and Zoellick was of ""interest and attention"". Nothing more. 
	
	
 Translating roughly, what Minister Lafer tried to tell the Americans is that the financial cost of an international rescue of Argentina, now, led by the IMF and other multilateral credit agencies, will be lower than the cost of fighting, later on, chaos in its social, political, and - why not? - military forms on the continent. 
	
	
 South America is already living with complex problems in Venezuela and, above all, in Colombia, where President Andres Pastrana is unable to combat the guerrilla activities of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia [FARC] and failed in the recent attempt to negotiate an agreement with its militants. For Brazilian diplomacy, Pastrana lost time and credibility on a failed bet: the negotiations with FARC, letting them control territory the size of Switzerland in the heart of the continent. 
	
	
 To add a country like Argentina to this list of problems is to allow the growth of a dangerous focus of social dissatisfaction, which is tending to express itself outside of any institutional control. Argentine society is divorcing itself from political parties and national institutions, and it is in such an environment that radical responses germinate, such as authoritarian regimes and the formation of guerrilla groups. 
	
	
 The ill effects of the Argentine crisis can contaminate the nearest countries first, like Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia. And there is no guarantee that a political destabilization of the region would bypass even Chile, where memories of the military dictatorship are still very strong. One cannot ignore the fact that, only 20 years ago, all these countries - including Brazil and Peru - were ruled by generals. 
	
	
 There is an entire. political and diplomatic argument in the conversations with representatives of the Bush government that transcends the economic-financial discussions, to which the subject was restricted, and which encompasses the very survival of democracy in South America. It is a new approach, which tries to sensitize US authorities through the use of geopolitical arguments. Not to take into account the impact of destabilization in South America in a world already complicated by the Middle East, India versus Pakistan, Afghanistan, and badly-resolved problems in Eastern Europe, ""is not to have a strategic vision,"" according to the assessment that is being made in Planalto Palace and which was clearly emphasized during Lafer's meetings with Powell, Zoellick and Evans. 
	
	
 The Brazilian Government's perception of Argentina's future is pessimistic. There is a stress factor in the content and volume of the needs of that country, which on its own will not be able to take the steps absolutely necessary for its reconstruction. This is the understanding of sources very close to President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and it is also guiding the analyses of the economic department. 
	
	
 What is underway in the neighboring country, according to information gathered by the Brazilian Government, is the establishment of a Central Bank - which 10 years ago abdicated from the traditional functions of currency and credit manager - that is capable of working with a floating exchange rate system and a regime of inflation goals, like Brazil's Central Bank; a safety network for the financial system whose health is already extremely undermined; the restructuring of the tax policy so that the tax collection machine can create conditions for the government to draw up a budget without so many uncertainties; and a fiscal responsibility law that imposes some discipline on the relationship between central government and the provinces. 
	
	
 ""This is the minimum that has to be done. Their economic agenda alone is overwhelming,"" comments one high-ranking member of the Brazilian Government. Alone, and under the command of a president who managed to create a strong political coalition explained only by his own survival instinct, Argentines will be unable to attain the most basic economic, social and political stability. How does this affect Brazil? To answer a question of this nature, the Brazilian Foreign Minister would surely resort to Ortega y Gasset: ""I am I and my circumstances. If I do not save them, I do not save myself.""

Tomorrow the government will announce a comprehensive economic and social plan based on the complete elimination of the dollar as a monetary standard through the conversion of deposits and loans into pesos. 
	
	
 For those owing less than $100,000, the conversion will be done at the rate of one to one. For those who owe between $100,000 and $300,000, the conversion rate will be 1.2 to 1, with the government making up the difference between this rate and that of the official dollar. It will help out the banks, as El Cronista reported, by giving them a bond or certificate against future revenues from the tax on crude oil exports (5 billion) and with part of the assistance that the IMF will reportedly provide (4 billion). Debts of more than $300,000 will continue to be converted at 1.4 to 1. 
	
	
 Barring last minute changes, no announcement is expected about allowing the peso to float freely, as the IMF would like, or about changes in the timetable for easing bank withdrawal restrictions. Under these restrictions, which were established by Domingo Cavallo and tightened by his successor, Jorge Remes Lenicov, the country's savers are barred from accessing more than 65 billion (pesos and mainly dollars) that they have on deposit. 
	
	
 This constraint, combined with the difficulties of even withdrawing money for daily use from salary direct-deposit accounts, has heightened social unrest, as people have staged marches, banging on pots and pans, and other demonstrations to protest the prevailing economic situation. 
	
	
 Some analysts feel that the fledgling Duhalde administration is making a mistake by ending convertibility without first resolving the problems that will arise from this decision, which was a foregone conclusion here in Argentina and the rest of the world. What is more, the IMF tried to convince Cavallo to abandon the one-to-one peg in an orderly fashion. 
	
	
 The fact that the former minister and President Fernando de la Rua, who later stepped down, were opposed to such a move drove the IMF even further away from lending any support. Its last show of support was the $8 billion in aid to support the ""zero deficit"" tactic. 
	
	
 Such budgetary discipline turned out to be impossible, thus shattering the rigid convertibility system and putting entire sectors of the economy out of commission. Lack of confidence led to massive withdrawals of savings into safer places. 
	
	
 The outflows forced some banks to ask the government to set limits. Cavallo could think of nothing better than the curbs on withdrawals. According to former Minister Roque Fernandez, it was ""the worst mistake in the history of the Argentine economy,"" while influential businessman Arnaldo Musich (FIEL [Latin American Economic Research Foundation]-Techint) considered it an ""inexcusable"" mistake. 
	
	
 Burdensome Legacy 
	
	
 The last of the provisional governments that took over from the abbreviated De la Rua administration decided quickly to end the currency board system. But not until tomorrow, one month after taking office, will it announce a comprehensive plan to overcome the worst crisis in the country's history. 
	
	
 Duhalde will confirm that $2 billion will be made available immediately to mitigate the social disaster. This money was approved by the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank. 
	
	
 Accompanied by Remes, he will talk tomorrow about what the assistance will be used for: to fulfill the promise to create a million jobs, to provide basic health care, and to undertake small infrastructure projects. The president will also mention imminent political reform, which he will call on Congress to enact. 
	
	
 The rest of his remarks will be solely about the economy, about which millions of Argentines have been obsessed for some years now. Mortgage loans, the debts of small and mid-sized companies, and automotive loans under $100,000 will be paid back in the identical amount of pesos. The same will go for secured loans under $300,000 and personal loans of up to $10,000. 
	
	
 Debts over these amounts will have to be repaid at 1.4 to 1, although the government will defray 20 cents on the dollar so that debtors will actually pay 1.2 pesos. 
	
	
 The banking restrictions will, for the time being, remain unchanged, but the tacit assumption is that the timetable for easing them will be speeded up ""as soon as conditions permit."" It has been confirmed that there will be ""coupons"" for savers who want to buy things, with their frozen funds as collateral. 
	
	
 The president will also break down the budget for the press and promise to issue currency in a controlled manner (not to exceed 3.5 billion pesos) and to undertake the difficult task of reversing the sudden decline in wealth (4.9 percent) without pushing inflation beyond 15 percent. 
	
	
 The dollar will be allowed to float as soon as possible, as the government has promised the IMF. Everything depends on the anticipated aid of between $15 billion and $20 billion, which is what has been requested of Washington. 
	
	
 Adjustment Index Will Be New Variable 
	
	
 One of the points on which the Duhalde administration's economic plan will be based is a monetary benchmark that will govern the issuance of pesos and the refunding of deposits in dollars that have been frozen in accounts. 
	
	
 To this end, Jorge Remes Lenicov's economic team has developed an index or formula including such parameters as projected annual inflation rates, the government's budget, the exchange rate of the dollar, and issuance of money by the Central Bank. 
	
	
 This system, which will serve as a financial tool for redrafting most of the contracts involving economic activity in the new, post-convertibility era, is similar to the ""Celic"" index that Brazil uses or the ""Unidad de Fomento"" that Chile used until August 2001. 
	
	
 The monetary benchmark that Brazil employs and that Chile used to is the most common one in today's world and is based on an inflation target. On the basis of this target a rule is developed to determine the interest rate needed to hit the target for price rises. The amount of money issued thus winds up being a function of these variables, not a target in itself, so that monetary policy can be used as a tool for promoting economic recovery. 
	
	
 Until August of last year Chile had an incremental adjustment mechanism that included an exchange rate band with a ceiling and floor. Monetary adjustments were based on what was called the ""unidad de fomento,"" an indexing system that included various price indices and adjusted contracts in accordance with actual changes. 
	
	
 Brazil started using an inflation target once its 1999 devaluation stabilized the real and achieved low inflation. 
	
	
 The government explained that it theoretically saw tools like the ""unidad de fomento"" as a way of adjusting the deposits of savers that will remain subject to restrictions until at least next year. The index will persumably not be applied for another two or three months, and it has not been ruled out that it may include loans already converted into pesos. 
	
	
 Renes is working alongside a group of technicians from the IMF, World Bank, US Treasury Department, and Central Bank of Brazil, whose services were also used during the crises in Mexico and Indonesia. 
	
	
 [Buenos Aires Ambito Financiero in Spanish on 1 February adds the following: ""The following are the main measures that will be announced tomorrow: 
	
	
 ""'Dirty' float for the dollar: The decision has been made to abolish the official exchange rate (1.4 pesos to the dollar) and to move towards a single, floating rate. The Central Bank will intervene in the market, but only to prevent sudden swings. Intermediate solutions have been completely ruled out, such as periodic adjustments of the exchange rate (a crawling peg) or a band, which would oblige the Central Bank to intervene by selling dollars to defend a given value of the peso. The government wanted to wait until it had sealed an accord with the IMF before going to a float. But since the negotiations will take several weeks, as Remes will not be flying to Washington until 14 February, the idea is to move ahead before receiving international aid. Another possibility is to have released at least the $2.6 billion that has been pending disbursement since December in order to bolster reserves before the peso is allowed to float. 
	
	
 ""Total release of salary direct-deposit accounts: All employees will soon be able to access their entire salary by making cash withdrawals from savings accounts. This will completely eliminate the ceiling of 1,500 pesos per month that had been set in the January version of the banking restrictions. This measure will benefit only the 4 percent of workers who earn more than that amount, which until now was subject to the restrictions. The danger, which the economic team is aware of, is that any additional money withdrawn will go straight into purchases of dollars since this could represent the percentage of income that an individual is able to save. The measure is designed to send a signal so that people gradually regain confidence. Raising the withdrawal ceiling in the case of regular savings accounts to 1,500 pesos a month was under consideration yesterday, but for now the limit of 1,200 a month will continue to apply, with the possibility of gradual increases in the near future. 
	
	
 ""Deposits to be converted into pesos at 1.4 to 1: Time deposits in dollars will be converted into pesos at the official rate. Once they have been converted, the refund timetable for dollar deposits will initially be maintained. In other words, refunds will not begin until January 2003. If an agreement is reached with the IMF and economic conditions improve, the timetable will likely be moved forward so that people can get cash. The possibility of keeping a portion of a time deposit in dollars, which President Duhalde has requested, has not been altogether ruled out, but there are legal problems with implementing it. In the case of time deposits in pesos, the refund timetable is being maintained; it provides for withdrawals in cash as of March. 
	
	
 ""Installment checks for time deposits: The money subject to a refund timetable may be used for purchases, but with restrictions. It cannot be credited to demand deposit accounts. Therefore, it can be used only to purchase items such as cars and apartments. The 12, 18, or 24 installments into which time deposits will be divided, depending on their amount, may be endorsed. Transfer of the time deposit will be authorized only in the case of a purchase. But the account holder will not be able to move it from one bank to another. The big drawback to this system is that hardly anyone will be willing to sell real estate for peso-denominated installment checks that can be cashed sometime in the future. They can be used, though, for smaller transactions or to pay for part of a purchase. 
	
	
 ""Issuance of bonds indexed according to the value of the dollar: The Central Bank will soon start issuing bonds in pesos to offer the public another alternative to purchasing dollars. The idea is to issue very short-term bills (30 days, for now) that will be indexed to any ongoing depreciation. An arrangement with an attractive implicit interest rate could also be devised. It will not be easy, of course, to drum up demand with the country in full-fledged default. 
	
	
 ""No withholding on oil exports: In conclusion, the government has decided to reverse itself on the 20 percent tax that it was planning to levy on these exports. 'We would not have raised all that much money and would have been sending a very bad signal overseas by discriminating between sectors,' acknowledged a senior source in the Economy Ministry. In any event, the oil industry may be asked for an advance on taxes due, as had been under consideration a couple of weeks ago. If any withholding arrangement is implemented, it will apply to all exports, not just some. 
	
	
 ""Bonds in dollars to compensate banks: The banks will receive long-term government bonds in dollars as compensation for the losses that will arise from conversion into pesos on their balance sheets. Estimates are that under the arrangement that has been devised the red ink will total more than 12 billion pesos or some $6 billion. The banks have also agreed with this option. They wold rather hold a financial claim on the government than place the entire burden on their debtors, who would be forced to declare bankruptcy if they got no relief. 
	
	
 ""Phase 1 of the swap remains in dollars: Banks, Pension and Retirement Fund Management Companies, and insurance companies exerted strong pressure to prevent all accounts from being converted into pesos at 1.4 to 1. They managed to keep their bonds in foreign currency and are supposed to start collecting interest this April. It is likely, however, that before that the government will move ahead with a comprehensive debt rescheduling, including international and local investors who were involved in the first phase of the swap.""]

President Bush's projection of Iran, Iraq and North Korea as 'axis of evil' and his threat of military action against them has evoked world-wide criticism. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said after meeting US Vice President Dick Cheney in Washington that there is no evidence of weapons' proliferation against these nations to substantiate the US charge. French officials said that the rhetoric of good and evil is not suitable for the realities of today's world. Former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that Bush has made a 'big mistake' by lumping the three nations together as they are different from each other. NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson said in New York that credible evidence will be prerequisite for NATO's support for any military action against the three nations. 
	
	
 The lumping of Iran, Iraq and North Korea as 'axis of evil' by President Bush has certainly not raised US image. It has rather tarnished it, since the international community expects a mature, compassionate and civilised conduct from the United States as the only superpower in the world. It should have been on the side of the smaller and weaker nations, rather than targeting them one by one in the pursuit of its global agenda. It should have worked to eliminate injustice, instead of trying to harass other countries for national prejudices. The world expects a civilised conduct from the United States in place of arrogance, discrimination and injustice. Washington is, in fact, treading a path of coercion, intimidation and blackmailing against the smaller and weaker nations. President Bush is intolerant to the dissent to his policy of domination in total negation of the lofty principles of morality, ethic and democracy, which he assertively holds so dear to his heart. If terrorism is to be fought successfully, the United States should better withdraw its support to the forces of injustice, tyranny and oppression in the world. Fight against poverty alone will not be a productive effort to fight terrorism. It's injustice that breeds hatred and revolt. Let Middle East be the test ground for US sincerity to fight terrorism. Its unfettered support to Israel is based on injustice and this distortion in its policies needs to be removed to ensure its own security as well as that of its allies.

In his annual address to the Congress and the American people, the US President named three countries whose regimes he thinks pose a serious threat to the whole world. These countries are North Korea, Iran, and Iraq, which he described as an ""axis of evil."" He also named four Islamic ""terrorist groups"", three of them being on Israel's and one on India's blacklist. In George Bush's presentation, any concrete references to the ""objects"" of Washington's extraordinary attention were thus exhausted. 
	
	
 Why Such a Selection? 
	
	
 It is open to question why such a selection was made. What is the difference between the Hamas movement, whose supporters do not hesitate to use terrorist methods in their resistance to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and, say, some groups of Chechen radicals using the same methods in their struggle for establishing an independent state? Incidentally, some founders of the Israeli State once did not hesitate to use such methods, either.... 
	
	
 No, it is not possible to yield to any form of terrorism or to try to justify it, but it is also apparent that any opportunistic selectivity could, in the final analysis, only jeopardize the success of the global war against it. This is perceived extremely sensitively in the Arab and Islamic world. 
	
	
 An ""Almost-Missile"" Trio 
	
	
 When it comes to answering the question of why George Bush only mentioned Iraq, Iran, and the People's Republic of Korea of the seven countries whose regimes the US Foreign Department considers ""rogue,"" the situation is a bit clearer. The issue is that compared with the remaining part of the blacklist (Libya, Syria, Sudan, and Somalia), this trio has made the greatest progress in its effort to obtain missile technologies, as well as chemical, bacteriological, or nuclear weapons. 
	
	
 ""States like these, and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger, because they could provide these arms to terrorists,"" stated Bush. However, he did not answer the question of how to proceed effectively against this trio. In the West European media reactions, most critical remarks were made about Bush shaking his finger of warning at Iran. Analysts are pointing out that this policy weakens the positions of the moderate forces and plays into the hands of fundamentalists there. 
	
	
 Pressure on the Budget 
	
	
 The President made it clear that his administration will spare no expenses to guarantee increased security for the United States and all its allies. The antiterrorist war itself costs the federal Treasury a huge amount of money. Direct expenses alone reach more than $1 billion a month, that is, $30 million a day. 
	
	
 Bush pointed out that, as far as Afghanistan is concerned, this war ""is only beginning,"" which is why the US Army must be prepared for ""future operations."" The Department of Defense, whose budget was increased by 19 percent last year, received even more for the fiscal year 2002/2003, which means that it can use a sum comparable to the amount from the times of the cold war confrontation.

Beijing, 3 Feb (Xinhua)-- In his recent State of the Union address, US President Bush quite unexpectedly labeled Iran, Iraq, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea [DPRK] as an ""axis of evil."" That statement immediately caused extensive controversy. It goes without saying that the three countries mentioned reacted strongly to it and other countries also found it very abrupt, so they all started trying to decipher the message within. Does an ""axis of evil"" really exist in today's world? The answer should be negative. 
	
	
 At the mention of the word ""axis,"" one would inevitably be reminded of the military alliance formed by fascist Germany, Italy, and Japan during World War II in the 1940's. That military alliance was powerful and constantly on a quest of expansion. It was brutal and reeked of blood, turning the whole world upside down. Their cause was an unjust one and therefore had little support. They were destined to collapse, disintegrate, and meet with a total failure; their reputation was ruined in historical records; and they earned eternal notoriety. Obviously, the ""title"" of ""axis"" is something in international relations that every country would do anything to avoid, so Iran, Iraq, and the DPRK naturally want to clean themselves of the dirty water that someone else have thrown on them. 
	
	
 To form an ""axis,"" it is imperative to form an alliance, but there is no alliance whatsoever among Iran, Iraq, and the DPRK. In particular, Iran and Iraq are at loggerheads with each other to this day. In terms of strength, these three countries cannot be mentioned in the same breath as Germany, Italy, and Japan in the 1940's. Quite on the contrary, these three are all developing nations and have experienced slow economic development because of sanctions imposed by the West, so there is no chance of them boosting their military strength significantly. 
	
	
 That being the case, why has the only superpower in today's world insisted that they are the new ""axis of evil?"" According to President Bush, all these three countries ""sponsor terrorism"" and attempt to ""develop weapons of mass destruction."" But so far, there has been no conclusive evidence indicating that the government of any of them was involved in the ""11 September"" incident of terrorist attacks that happened in the United States last year. Moreover, Iran made a clear stand in support of the war against terror after the incident. As to whether or not they have developed weapons of mass destruction, all three countries have denied it, but the United States does not believe them. However, even if they did have this kind of weapons, who would dare to use them against the United States, the world's number one nuclear nation, either directly or indirectly through terrorists, while risking the danger of being completely annihilated? Actually, these three countries do have one common denominator, i.e., that their values and polices do not agree with those of the United States and none of them are on good terms with the United States. That is why many people suspect the purpose of the United States' putting Iran, Iraq, and the DPRK in the box of ""evil axis"" is to prepare public opinion for possible strikes against these old foes under the banner of fighting terror. 
	
	
 At present, very few in the international community have responded in favor of the theory of ""evil axis,"" because many countries, including China, have made clear their stand against willful expansion of the war against terror. The other day, Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov said: ""It is unacceptable to Russia to mechanically extend the scope of antiterrorist action to any country, including Iraq."" Furthermore, the Russian side has stressed time and time again that the United States' accusations against Iran, Iraq, and the DPRK should be settled within the UN framework and raised objections to any hostile action against these three countries without authorization from the Security Council. In fact, even the US ally, Britain, and other Western countries have indicated that the antiterrorist military action should be conducted with restraint, for otherwise the danger of losing control will emerge. It seems that the market for the theory of ""evil axis"" is still limited.

There are now 158 al-Qaeda and Taliban prisoners held in eight-by-six-foot open-air steel cages at the US naval base of Guantanamo Bay, while another 270 are in the custody of US forces in Afghanistan. They too are likely to be flown to similar camps sooner or later, though their shifting has been put on hold in the face of deep international outrage at the way Washington is treating these prisoners. Secretary Rumsfeld has justified the atrocious conditions by resorting to verbal quibbling by designating them as 'unlawful combatants' or 'battlefield detainees', to avoid giving them PoW status under the Geneva Conventions. TV footage has shown hooded and shackled prisoners in steel cages, reminiscent more of Nazi concentration camps than a civilised detention facility. No figure has been provided by Washington nor demanded by Islamabad, but a fairly large number of these dehumanised detainees are believed to be Pakistanis. Saudi Arabia, France and even Britain have protested over the inhuman treatment, and demanded repatriation of their nationals. 
	
	
 Unlike Pakistan, these governments have at least gone to the trouble of finding out how many of their citizens, no matter how misguided, are being held. Human rights groups have also condemned this grave violation of the Geneva Conventions. Islamabad's silence does not set a healthy precedent. The guilt or otherwise of these detainees can be determined only by a competent court. The USA itself admits that one of the possible fates of these prisoners is to stand trial in competent courts in their own countries. If the US is willing to allow their repatriation back home to stand trial under Pakistani laws, why is Pakistan so coy about exercising this option? Incidentally, another 325 Pakistanis are currently rotting in Afghan jails. In this case also, Islamabad is pretending they do not exist. Pakistan has pledged $100 million for Afghan reconstruction. It should at least take up its own citizens' plight with the Karzai administration. Despite the powerful compulsions it is apparently labouring under, Islamabad should at least seek details of the Pakistanis being held at Guantanamo Bay, so that their cases can be taken up with Washington later. A proactive approach, for once, is called for.

The arrogance that marked the latest Manichaean pronouncement of the US President, George W. Bush, alleging an ""axis of evil"" on the international stage has justifiably produced a backlash of adverse reactions. In his State of the Union address to the US lawmakers on January 29, Mr. Bush categorically identified Iran, as also Iraq and North Korea, besides their ""terrorist allies"" as a functional anti-US entity and as a collective ""axis of evil"" in the global arena. By raising this new political bogey in the specific context of the present US-led international ""campaign"" against terrorism and by aggressively harping on such ideas at a Republican caucus on February 1, Mr. Bush has left little or no room for doubt about his real foreign policy intentions. The defining characteristic of the presumptive ""axis of evil"" is portrayed as a tendency on the part of its constituent states and non-state players to acquire weapons of mass destruction [WMDs]. What is more, Mr. Bush has already begun articulating a policy designed to ""prevent"" such ""outlaw regimes"" and their ""terrorist"" cohorts from ""threatening America"" and its ""friends and allies"". It is in this climate of an impassioned American campaign against new phobias that some powers like China have joined the chorus of protest by the three countries named by Mr. Bush. 
	
	
 There is no reason to cavil at the universal consensus against terrorism on the international stage. Yet, the least that Mr. Bush should have done is to prove his accusations of a collusive nexus among Iran and Iraq, two Islamic countries, and North Korea, arguably a reclusive `Stalinist' state, besides their alleged ""terrorist"" accomplices. The communicative compulsions of dancing to the tunes of evocative sound bytes cannot adequately explain Mr. Bush's failure to substantiate this theme during his internationally televised address. His denunciation of Iran, in particular, is a case that illustrates Washington's urge to underline America's supposed pre-eminence as the only superpower in history with a universal jurisdiction. By provoking Iran at this sensitive stage in the global ""campaign"" against terror, Mr. Bush has inadvertently encouraged the protagonists of a prospective ""clash of civilizations"", a controversial thesis that underlines the religious divide. 
	
	
 Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has described the US itself as ""the greatest evil"". Given Mr. Bush's objections to the suspected Iranian plans of acquiring WMDs, Ayatollah Khamenei is critical of America's archetypal ""sales of lethal weapons"" to Israel and others. However, it has been left to Iran's President, Mohammad Khatami, to reaffirm Teheran's sustainable advocacy of a ""dialogue among civilizations"" as the cultured answer to the ""insults"" that Mr. Bush has now heaped upon the Iranian people. While Iraq and North Korea tend to see America's new game plan as an extension of its characteristic policy of ""hegemony"", China is aghast at the ridiculous terminology of America's new thinking and its unexplained logical basis. In a macro-perspective, it appears that Mr. Bush has chosen to raise this new specter so as to promote his pet theme of a space-age missile defense system for America and its allies. This may, in part, explain why he clubbed two Islamic states with a religion!
-neutral country. At the micro-level, though, the US President has obviously counted on his country's several different disputes with Iran, Iraq and North Korea over time. As for Teheran specifically, its defiant view of America's expanding strategic-military presence in Iran's neighborhood at this juncture may have weighed with Mr. Bush. In the event, the dynamics of an emerging Iran-US tussle will determine his actions against the ""axis"". Clearly at this point there is no cause for the international community to support American efforts to widen the campaign beyond Afghanistan.

Recently, US President Bush, in the State of the Union address he gave before Congress, recklessly picked on our country, saying we develop and possess weapons of mass destruction [WMD]. He then spewed out all kinds of vicious remarks, picking on a few countries, which included our country, as countries that destroy so-called peace of the United States and the world and that we are part of an axis of evil. This markedly reveals [the United States'] extremely dangerous attempt to link our Republic to terrorism by force and crush us at all costs with military strength and is no more than showing, to the international community, Bush to be the most vicious war maniac himself. 
	
	
 As we all know, our Republic is currently exerting every effort possible for peace on and reunification of the Korean peninsula and for the world's peace and security. At the beginning of this year, for instance, our Republic's government clearly conveyed, again, its steadfast position and will to achieve the fatherland's reunification, the greatest ardent desire of the nation, within the first few years of the 21st century at all costs by the united efforts of the nation. It convened a joint meeting by the Republic's government and political parties and organizations and announced the three appeals and three proposals, which reflect the entire nation's unanimous desire and will. This is the fairest and the most realistic and patriotic manifestation for opening a decisive breakthrough in the achievement of the fatherland's reunification cause this year at all costs by the united efforts of our nation under the banner of the 15 June North-South Joint Declaration. It is also a remarkable measure for safeguarding peace and security on the Korean peninsula. 
	
	
 In the meantime, our Republic's government has shown our principled position on terrorism on several occasions in accordance with the trend of the international community's opposition to terrorism. We have signed and joined anti-terrorist treaties such as International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. We have thus actively contributed to the preservation of global peace and security. 
	
	
 Despite all of this, however, US President Bush linked our country to terrorism by force and spewed out virulent remarks that our country is threatening the world's peace. What a brazen-faced deception of reality and unbearable insult to a sovereign state! What we cannot condone more than anything is that Bush arbitrarily designated our country as part of a so-called an axis of evil. 
	
	
 Good and evil are two completely contradictory concepts. In the current international community, promoting peace and stability, safeguarding a country and nation's sovereignty, and protecting people's lives and properties are good. Anything that goes against this can be said to be evil. 
	
	
 Our Republic is currently making every possible effort to reclaim national sovereignty by reunifying the fatherland as soon as possible and safeguard peace and security on the Korean peninsula and of Northeast Asia. Our Republic is also fiercely waging a fight against war or the exercise of military force in resolving international issues and is seeking ways to combat terrorism, and the international community is praising these efforts. 
	
	
 As can be seen from the aforementioned, there is no real evidence either to link our Republic to terrorism or to designate as an evil country. The real ringleader of evil and the base of evil is the United States. Manifest examples are the following facts. Over the recent 10 years alone, the US imperialists perpetrated open [word indistinct] state-level terrorism against sovereign states, such as Iraq and Yugoslavia, with preposterous reasons and pretexts. They are posing a grave threat to the world's peace and security, blabbing about the establishment of an invasive missile defense system. 
	
	
 In reality, the United States is truly a country that has no qualifications and face to take issue with other countries by saying that they are an evil and so on. Nevertheless, Bush is impertinently picking a quarrel regarding our Republic by saying this and that and viciously spoke ill of the DPRK. This is truly a very despicable act. 
	
	
 The shabby conduct by the US President Bush is nothing but revealing before the world each and every one of his political immaturity and moral corruption. As soon as the New Year set in, he proclaimed this year as a year of a war and then poured all kinds of abusive words against our Republic. Herein lies his wicked intention. It is to provoke an aggressive war opposing countries that they are not satisfied with, in particular the DPRK, and crush those countries through military strength. Through this, the United States is aiming to move away from the political and economic crisis that it is currently suffering from and continue to realize the policy of hegemony. 
	
	
 However, Bush is greatly miscalculating. Just like those who enjoy fire are bound to die by being burnt, the only thing that will be left to war maniacs like Bush, who tries to find a way out of a crisis through aggression and war, is a bitter destruction. 
	
	
 Our heroic People's Army and people will never tolerate the US imperialists' reckless military oppressive attempt and will pose a merciless annihilating blow to the aggressors.

New York -- The warlike tone of the State of the Union speech delivered by George Bush Tuesday evening has prompted responses as critical abroad as they are enthusiastic in the United States. Be that as it may, the aim pursued by the White House seems to have been achieved. This is to re-mobilize the country behind the war on terrorism and to prevent Americans, by returning to a more normal life, from concerning themselves chiefly with the daily repercussions of the Enron affair and rising unemployment. 
	
	
 In his fellow countrymen's eyes, the test constituted by 11 September has revealed George Bush's talents as a war leader. He is clearly more comfortable in this role than he is in he management of routine matters. His force of conviction when he preaches the struggle of good against evil largely explains his exceptional popularity ratings (83 percent of favorable opinions, according to the latest ABC and Washington Post surveys.) So on Tuesday evening George Bush tried to reproduce the tone of his 20 September speech in order to galvanize the country. ""The United States will not allow the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the most destructive weapons. Whatever the cost of our country's defense, we will pay it. The evil is real, and it must be combated... even in the midst of tragedy, specially in the midst of tragedy, God is there..."" 
	
	
 The unanimous opinion of the media is that he was successful in this. His speech was ""brilliant, full of strength and eloquence. The pursuit of the war on terrorism has given Americans a new illustration of his character and his confidence in the country's leadership,"" the New York Times said. According to the Washington Post , ""the President's intensity was equal to the need to pursue the war."" Television commentaries were even more full of praise. ""Solid and often eloquent remarks,"" CBS' Ran Rather said. CNN's Bill Bennett called it ""a speech of moral strength."" According to Fox's Juan Williams, ""the words came straight from the heart."" 
	
	
 The condemnation of the ""axis of evil"" comprising Iran, Iraq, and North Korea was applauded by Republican and Democrat hawks, and barely challenged by a few foreign relations experts. George Bush has succeeded not only in returning the war to the front pages of the newspapers, ousting the Enron affair and the budget deficit, but also in forcing the Democratic opposition to unite against the enemy. Dick Gephardt, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, and Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader in the Senate, have attempted the impossible feat of ""setting partisan attitudes aside and supporting our President 100 percent in the war on terrorism,"" while at the same time trying to criticize economic and social policy. 
	
	
 As for responses abroad, in order to make them somewhat less sharp, the administration has introduced some qualifications. This, among other things, by specifying that no military operations are planned against any of the three countries cited. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer even added that the expression ""axis of evil"" was not used in an allusion to the notorious Rome-Berlin-Tokyo axis. 
	
	
 However, George Bush is not about to change his rhetoric. ""In the antiterrorist struggle, as far as I am concerned there is black and white, and no shades of gray,"" he said Thursday 31 January during an election campaign visit to Atlanta, Georgia, and to Daytona beach, Florida. 
	
	
 The President said he was confident about the US allies' support against countries trying to acquire mass destruction weapons. ""The rest of the world needs to be with us, because such weapons can be targeted on them as well as on us."" He again urged these countries to ""clean their own homes."" ""If you are one of the countries that develops mass destruction weapons, and you are willing to ally with a terrorist group, or you currently support terrorism, or if you do not sincerely share the values precious to us, then you too will be under surveillance,"" he said.

Like other European countries, Belgium sent on Sunday [3 Feb] a diplomat to Guantanamo to verify the identity of a detainee who claims to have Belgian nationality. Meanwhile the United States is raising the volume in the matter of the struggle against terrorism. 
	
	
 A high Belgian diplomat posted to the United States left Washington on Sunday to go to the American base at Gauntanamo in Cuba where 158 Taliban who were captured during the military operations in Afghanistan are being held. The diplomat traveled in the company of his colleagues from several EU countries on board a special military flight. 
	
	
 Among the prisons, whose conditions of transport and detention continue to arouse controversy, there are several citizens of European countries, or those claiming to be such. One of the detainees has claimed Belgian nationality. This is a naturalized person who originated in a country of northern Africa. 
	
	
 This paper was told that Belgium expressed a certain amount of impatience with the American authorities after it learned, as did other European countries, that Great Britain and France have already been able to send a verification mission. 
	
	
 ""The United States Are Prepared To Fight Terrorism Alone"" 
	
	
 The priority for Belgium is to verify the identity of the detainee who claims its nationality. 
	
	
 It would only be in a later stage that Belgium could imagine providing assistance to the person who claims to be one of its citizens. But what type of assistance? The United States indeed is rejecting the idea that its prisoners, to whom it denies the status of prisoners of war, should receive consular support reserved for prisoners of common law. 
	
	
 However, this paper was told Sunday by the Foreign Affairs Ministry in Brussels that the diplomat sent to Guantanamo, who is supposed to stay at camp X-ray until Tuesday, also has the task of learning about the detention conditions of the ""Belgian Taliban"" or both. 
	
	
 A detail indeed shows American defiance as to European approaches: the army tried to impose an elevated price for the trip of the diplomats from Washington... [passage omitted]

The term ""Axis of Evil"" that President George W. Bush used to label Iraq, Iran, and North Korea has now become a hot, much-discussed phrase. The word ""axis"" reminds me of the grouping of countries during World War I and II that were enemies of the Allies. 
	
	
 Bush deliberate used the term to emphasize to the world the adversarial US position toward the three countries that, according to Washington's claim, still assist terrorists and seek to develop lethal weapons. 
	
	
 As reminder, former US President Ronald Reagan used to call the Soviet Union ""the Evil Empire."" 
	
	
 Bush's objective is clear. He simply condenses his foreign policy for others to easily understand by distinguishing the evil from the good. He claims that he belongs to the good side and whoever is on the other side is the evil that must be destroyed or at least deserves condemnation. It is not enough that he sees those countries as evil, he wants his allies to feel the same way about them as well. For the countries that regard the three countries as friends or not evil, they are considered to be enemies of the United States. 
	
	
 The events on 11 September forced Bush to overhaul the US foreign policy. Foreign policy was an issue that he never wanted to deal with before. Many believed that Bush was naive about foreign affairs. In the presidential election, he campaigned on economic and education issues and barely scraped through. But the unexpected happened and what followed -- Usama Bin Ladin and the war in Afghanistan -- have elevated foreign policy to become the central part of his administration. 
	
	
 The circumstance has led Bush to again adopt an aggressive policy. He has declared that the war against terrorism will not end at Afghanistan but will spread to other parts of the world. It does not matter where in the world, he will vigorously hunt terrorists down if they are perceived to seek to target the United States. 
	
	
 As Bush has declared that Iraq, Iran, and North Korea are the ""Axis of Evil,"" it emphatically implies that he regards it as duty to stop them from manufacturing or acquiring lethal weapons, be they chemical, biological, or nuclear. 
	
	
 The line that Bush draws between friends and foes has never been any clearer. Basically, he is telling the world the enemies of America is not just al-Qa'ida or Usama Bin Ladin. The countries that possess the lethal weapons are the targets of suppression by the United States. 
	
	
 A close look will show that the United States has already carried out this aggressive policy in abrupt and rapid manner without comprehensively consulting with the countries concerned. For example, some 660 US soldiers have been dispatched to the Philippines to join Filipino soldiers to suppress the Abu Sayyaf. Although the US role is identified as participation in military exercise or as adviser, the real purpose is the soldiers are sent there to participate in missions that the targets are the groups that are regarded as enemies of the United States. 
	
	
 The new US policy deserves to be closely analyzed and monitored. It is necessary for Thai people to understand the important change in the policy of the country whose economic, political, and military influence impact on the world the most. 
	
	
 Whether a country agrees with and regardless of how it views the US policy, the United States is taking the direction that emphasizes its national security and confrontation with the countries that Washington regards as enemies. This may result in more intense armed confrontation. The terrorist groups may step up sabotage of US targets and the US allies. 
	
	
 The US naming of North Korea may annoy China, given its assistance to the United States in the war in Afghanistan. Iran tried to become more helpful to the United States during the war in Afghanistan, but now that it has been identified as an ""evil"" it likely will readjust its stance. 
	
	
 The world has heated up a notch.

KABUL, Feb 3 (AFP) -- Fresh fighting has broken out between rival warlords in the northern Afghanistan city of Mazar-i-Sharif, a defence ministry official said Sunday. 
	
	
 There was a ""one to two hour"" battle Saturday between forces loyal to Uzbek warlord General Abdul Rashid Dostam and those of rival Tajik commander Atta Mohammad, defence ministry official Mira Jan said. 
	
	
 No one was injured, and the fighting stopped when local authorities intervened, Jan told AFP. 
	
	
 ""It was a minor clash, but investigations are continuing. We will identify the culprits of these clashes and punish them,"" he said. 
	
	
 It was the second reported clash in a fortnight involving the forces of Dostam, the interim government's deputy defence minister, and Tajik fighters. 
	
	
 Dostam's fighters and ethnic Tajiks loyal to former Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani previously battled in Kunduz province, east of Mazar-i-Sharif, leaving 11 dead. 
	
	
 Dostam and Rabbani's factions are seen as uneasy partners in the fragile Northern Alliance that fought the Taliban militia from 1996 until the hardline Islamic regime crumbled in the face of US bombing in November. 
	
	
 Jan called the fighting between local commanders a symptom of the 23 years of war that has devastated Afghanistan. 
	
	
 ""These battles have always happened in our country. Most of them occur usually for personal interests,"" he said. 
	
	
 The factional infighting has raised fears that long-standing ethnic rivalries could again split the country after the defeat of the Taliban.

When George W. Bush was delivering the State of the Union Speech to both Senate and the House of Representatives of US Congress on 29 January, with unprecedented wordings he lashed out at DPRK (the Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Iran and Iraq, labeling the three countries as the ""Axis of Evil"". The three countries have reacted strongly, condemned and counter-attacked Bush, and this is only natural and rational. Some senior US government officials and experts and the Western allies of the United States have criticized Bush's speech, saying that the ""Axis of Evil"" is, more or less, untenable. 
	
	
 Albright: First to Launch Attack 
	
	
 On 1 February, when interviewed by the American Broadcasting Corporation, Madeleine Albright, former US Secretary of State, described Bush's ""Axis of Evil"" remark as ""a gross mistake"". She said that the principle Bush currently uses in handling foreign affairs has caused the international community to think that the United States is doing things ""in an utterly disorderly way"" and has ""lost reason"". She said: ""putting the three countries together is a gross mistake."" She is particularly opposed to listing the DPRK in the so-called Axis of Evil, saying that Bush's way of doing things will possibly cause the United States to lose popular support among the international community. Albright particularly noted that she had contacted and reached agreement with the DPRK. Whereas Bush has ""single-handedly destroyed"" the initial relationship she had established with Korea during the Clinton age. Albright also pointed out that the situation in Iran at the present stage is very complicated. She said that on the Afghanistan issue and some other questions, the United States still needs the aid of Iran. 
	
	
 Carpenter, deputy director of the US non-governmental research organization the Cato Institute, holds that Bush's criticism of Korea by name is really hard to understand. The deputy director said, ""It's really strange for Bush to include Korea on the list of these countries, because in recent years Korea has not actively supported terrorist activities. Furthermore, ""according to evidence in our hands,"" he added, ""Korea's nuclear project has all along been frozen since the mid-1990s. I don't know why Bush listed Korea as one among the terrorist countries."" 
	
	
 Some commentaries said that including Korea on the ""Axis of Evil"" list would irritate Korea and would cause Japan and the Republic of Korea (ROK) feel disturbed. 
	
	
 An analytical article carried in the Washington Post says that including Iran on the ""Axis of Evil"" list is all the more astonishing. The article says that the United States tried hard to establish a new relationship with Iran last fall and expressed its appreciation for Iran's condemnation of terrorism. Iran also indicated that in case US pilots were hit in Afghanistan and landed in Iran, Iran would give them assistance. The analyst was worried that Bush's attack on Iran would possibly forfeit all recent efforts. 
	
	
 Carpenter also said that in this way, the door to improving relations with Iran would be completely blocked. He added that that would be the most unfortunate part of Bush's speech, he cast away the chance for improving relations with Iran. Now President Bush has completely closed the door to improvement of ties with Iran. 
	
	
 Difficult for Britain and France To Agree with US 
	
	
 After he set forth the ""Axis of Evil"" theory in his State of the Union speech, Bush met with increasing attacks from the international community. Even US closest allies also thought it hard to agree with Bush's remark. 
	
	
 A report carried in British Daily Telegraph on 2 February said that British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw queried the ""Axis of Evil"" theory set forth in Bush's State of the Union speech, thinking that such a remark of Bush attempts to use the anti-terror war to play with political party politics. Straw added that Britain and the United States had become the closest allies after the ""September 11"" incident, now they may no longer stand shoulder to shoulder. 
	
	
 French President Jacques Chirac does not subscribe to the ""Axis of Evil"" theory advanced by US President Bush. Chirac's assistant indicated that the good-and-evil view does not conform to the actual conditions in the present-day world. The French presidential office does not make open comments on Bush's statement, it only says that what Bush says is directed mainly to the Americans. 
	
	
 At the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum held in New York, NATO Secretary General George Robertson said that in charging Korea, Iran and Iraq with so-called ""Axis of Evil"", the United States must produce evidence. Observers in Washington maintain that the NATO Secretary-general's statement indicates that the international community feels uneasy about the Bush administration's policy which seems to be determined to expand the scope of the anti-terror war. 
	
	
 White House and State Department Hasten to Smooth the Matter Over 
	
	
 In a bid to alleviate the sentiments of US allies, a White House official has discretely assured US allies that Bush does not hint to take military actions. 
	
	
 Secretary of State Colin Powell admonishes his subordinates that when the mass media discuss the matter, the spirit and literal meaning of Bush's speech must be strictly acted upon to avoid causing doubts in the external world. The State Department said on 1 February that they would collect various statements and send them to US embassies in various countries worldwide, so as to calm down foreign countries' negative reactions to Bush's speech. US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said: ""We will send all relevant information and summaries of this information to our embassies in various places around the world to facilitate understanding of the related arguments."" 
	
	
 An US government official said that US diplomats to countries concerned are authorized to explain to these countries which may have doubts about Bush's State of the Union speech, this is aimed at dispelling various countries' doubt that the United States is about to dispatch troops to Iran, Iraq and Korea.

Seeing in believing, and the longer you live the more you see. It was written, the episode was broadcast live, and there was no way that those words from the president of the Republic were adulterated, deformed, or falsified by the hidden agents of the media conspiracy. No. He asserted, in these exact words, this barbarism: ""4 February is not just any date, it is a historic date we can well compare to 19 April 1810, when that civic-military rebellion also opened a new path towards national independence."" 
	
	
 No one had gone so far in the anthology of rhetorical follies, or in falsifying history. No one had ever tried to compare themselves to, and put themselves in the same position, as the founders of the nation, as the thwarted leader of the 4 February 1992 coup has now tried to do. What is there about a coup against the constitutional order that could resemble the most important day in Venezuelan history? In what way can Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez be seen as comparable to Jose Felix Ribas, Francisco Salias, the philosopher Juan German Roscio, or Canon Jose Cortes de Madariaga? 
	
	
 No. This is a simple lack of respect, an abuse of history, an unacceptable degradation. Chavez did not try to overthrow Fernando VII, and if it had been up to him we would still be under the domination of the Bourbon dynasty. 4 February is one of the most terrible days in Venezuelan history. If he wants to look for a comparison, maybe he would find one in the likewise thwarted coup by Colonel Pedro Carujo against Jose Maria Vargas. Comparing it with 19 April 1810 is another armed coup and must be rejected with all determination by the academies and by those who in one way or another must preserve our historical legacy from adulteration or deceitful use. 4 February upset the lives of Venezuelans with the ghost of a military insurgency that we had all thought had been overcome, because it belonged to past eras and because the armed forces were fully within the legitimate order, complying with institutional precepts, far from the meddling forbidden by the constitution. 
	
	
 In fact, the armed forces made great contributions to the country's stability, because when each sector of Venezuelan society complies with what is set out for it in the legal order, countries are preserved from the vicissitudes of coup plotters. President Chavez himself now boasts of having spent 20 years conspiring -- that is, eroding the armed forces' loyalty -- to achieve his goal of conquering power. This is a great demonstration of political cynicism. 4 February was not only a military failure for Chavez; it was also an episode that caused enormous losses, human and economic, for all Venezuelans. There were numerous deaths, and no one can feel proud of the consequences. 4 February was such a failure that Chavez, even though it pained him, had to accept democratic methods to reach power. That was what happened in 1998, and still today, Chavez gives constant demonstrations of discontent and irritation at having been democratically elected. 
	
	
 The reason for this is simple: He has to respect the democratic rules of the game, the freedom of expression that causes him so many nightmares, the presence of the fundamental institutions of the nation whose right to exist he denies. He wants to disguise the failed date of 4 February to create the collective illusion of a military victory, which would permit him to govern us from Miraflores as if he really had reached power that day. Imagine what would have happened to us Venezuelans if in fact on that terrible day the lieutenant colonel, instead of staying in the museum, had advanced on the government building with the vast forces backing him. 
	
	
 Once he was taken prisoner, democracy exhausted all its generosity, just as Vargas did with Carujo. Venezuelan democracy has not given anyone as much as it gave Chavez. He should acknowledge these debts and make the effort to learn to live in a democracy, respecting others' rights. This system of freedoms made him president of the Republic. Trying to destroy it now is inconsistent. We must prevent his attempt to exercise power as if he had won on 4 February. This was not the case, and the Venezuelan people rejected him as a coup participant. Today, with this official ""celebration,"" Venezuela is in mourning.

US Secretary of State Colin Powell, described as one of the few enlightened officials in President Bush's administration, is trying to ""patch up"" President Bush's statements, especially his latest one in which he made reckless threats at the ""axis of evil,"" namely Iran, Iraq and North Korea. A day after President Bush's threat to crush these countries and use all means to prevent them from developing weapons of mass destruction, Secretary Powell said before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that ""characterizing these counties as the axis of evil does not mean that his government intends to invade them."" He added: ""We are prepared to initiate a dialogue, and we want to work with our friends and allies in the world on ways of dealing with such regimes."" 
	
	
 These are fine words, but they do not reflect the reality, because the hard-line wing in the US administration comprising Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice have the final say in running affairs at the White House, and have direct influence on President Bush. 
	
	
 Oddly enough, speculations swirled in Washington that Powell listened to President Bush's speech and his threats to ""the axis of evil"" like any other US citizen. He had not read the speech before President Bush delivered it, as he was supposed to do by virtue of his post. The fact that he subsequently denied these speculations does not mean they are baseless. 
	
	
 At any rate, Secretary Powell's remark about the US administration's readiness to enter dialogue with these ""evil"" states and with Washington's friends on ways of dealing with them involves some contradictions. For he affirmed in the first speech that there would be no dialogue with Iraq until after it has accepted the return of the UN arms inspectors. 
	
	
 The current US administration will consult with no one, not even its closest allies, whether in Europe or its followers in the Third World, particularly in the Arab world. The US administration has already decided to ""punish"" any country it believes poses a danger to the Hebrew State. It lumped North Korea with Iran and Iraq as part of the ""axis of evil"" only to mislead Arabs and Muslims and to create the impression that Islam is not alone targeted. 
	
	
 The United States is these days ruled by an alliance between two main lobbies, the arms lobby and the Zionist lobby, which sees the world through the eyes of Ari'el Sharon and his extremist government. We therefore have to expect the worst in the near future. 
	
	
 President Bush is facing a recession and an economic crisis. He does not want to repeat his father's mistake, being defeated in the next elections because of economic factors. He is therefore planning to trigger wars here and there to revive the flagging arms industry. 
	
	
 The United States is currently run by a typical Texan mentality, which is closer to that of cowboys than to a civilized mentality that believes in dialogue and coexistence among peoples. This mentality simultaneously raises apprehensions and resentment, because international economic prosperity can be built on stability, not wars. A catastrophe would engulf every country if the US arms industry progressed at the expense of the world's security and stability.

Hong Kong, 6 Feb (ZTS) News from Washington: 
	
	
 Secretary of State Colin Powell said on 5 February that it was not an alarmist remark when George W. Bush labeled Iran, Iraq, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea [DPRK] as the ""Axis of Evil"" when he was delivering the State of the Union Speech last week. 
	
	
 Powell's remark came when he attended a hearing sponsored by the Foreign Relations Committee of the US Senate and spoke in defense of the statement of the ""Axis of Evil"" which has been widely criticized. 
	
	
 According a report, during his two-hour discourse, Powell said that it is correct to describe Iran, Iraq, and the DPRK as the ""Axis of Evil."" He said: But this does not mean that the United States will launch a war against them. The United States does not rule out the possibility of holding dialogues with the countries of the Axis of Evil. 
	
	
 Powell said: The need to take actions against these countries does not mean that we will launch a war against or invade someone tomorrow. In the near future, this means that the United States will consider the three countries mentioned and other countries that might be mentioned as the major points of its policy. 
	
	
 Powell said: Bush's statement is similar to that of Ronald Reagan who described former USSR as an ""Evil Empire."" The United States is ready to cooperate with its allies and discuss with them how to deal with such regimes.

The statement by US Secretary of State Colin Powell about the Venezuelan Government triggered yesterday reactions from members of the ruling party. Mostly, they accused Washington of violating national sovereignty after the US ranking official voiced an opinion about Venezuela's foreign policy and questioned the democratic nature of the administration of Hugo Chavez. 
	
	
 Last Tuesday, before the US Senate's Foreign Policy Committee, Powell voiced his concern over ""several actions by President Chavez and his ideas of what is a democratic system."" He also criticized the visits by the chief of state to countries that are on the black list of supporters of terrorism, published by the administration of President George W. Bush, including Cuba, Libya, and Iraq. Guillermo Garcia Ponce Click here to view picture of Garcia Ponce , chief of the board of directors of the Political Command of the Revolution [CPR], described Powell's statement as ""unusual"" and added that it does not reflect the friendly relations between Caracas and Washington. 
	
	
 He stressed: ""Venezuela's domestic policy is the exclusive concern of Venezuelans because of our historical tradition and because it is a constitutional mandate."" He added: ""There is no reason for any country to request the agreement of others to determine its conduct and adopt its decisions."" Garcia Ponce, who said he was speaking on behalf of the entire CPR, pointed out that it would be ""truly inconceivable"" that the interference of a state to approve or disapprove the decisions of another or other states became a trait of foreign policy. 
	
	
 ""This is not in keeping with the rules of international law and violates the principle of nonintervention in the affairs of other countries,"" the top representative of the CPR noted. However, he ruled out that the statement by the US Foreign Secretary will lead to a change in the policies of President Chavez. 
	
	
 Deputy Cilia Flores, chief of bloc of the Fifth Republic Movement [MVR], used the same tone to express her opinion. Without mincing her words, she affirmed: ""This is an instance of meddling in the policies of this country, which is a sovereign country."" She added: ""Venezuela designs its own policies in an autonomous manner and, in any event, it is up to Venezuelans to decide them. We respect the sovereignty of all countries and this is why we demand respect for ours."" 
	
	
 As for the criticisms of the destinations of the presidential trips, she remarked: ""In addition to the fact that we do not have to ask anyone for permission to decide where and when we should visit a country, the President has visited countries with which we have direct trade relations, countries that are OPEC members, with the specific objective of strengthening our economy."" 
	
	
 Noheli Pocaterra, vice president of the National Assembly, stressed that it is up to Venezuela to decide its foreign policy and the United States must respect its decision. According to her, the remarks by the US Government spokesman were uncalled-for. She stated: ""We are quite respectful of the decisions made by Washington, even if we do not agree with them. We demand equal treatment for our foreign policy."" 
	
	
 The opposition seeks intervention or blockade [subhead] 
	
	
 MVR Deputy Pedro Carreno went even further and established a direct relation between the concerns voiced by the Secretary of State and the disclosure of a video that presumably confirms relations between the Venezuelan Government and the Colombian rebel groups. Journalists Ibeyise Pacheco, Marta Colomina, Patricia Poleo, and Marianela Salazar disclosed this video in recent days. 
	
	
 The deputy said that Powell's remarks did not surprise him and added that the US official's opinion is based on reports published by the domestic and international press, which is waging a ruthless war against the Venezuelan chief of state. He noted: ""The opposition is succeeding at portraying an image of Venezuela that scares away investors and triggers domestic turmoil to request the intervention of foreign powers in the country."" Thus, Carreno excused the White House official, whom - he argued - was misled by the smear campaign and information sabotage that has been unleashed against Chavez in the country and abroad. He took one further step and invited Powell to visit Venezuela to see what is really happening. 
	
	
 He accused the four journalists of plotting with powerful economic groups that presumably contributed the funds to purchase the video from an intelligence agent. He stressed that these journalists should be tried since, according to Article 122 of the Penal Code, any action that instigates interventionist actions is considered treason against the homeland. 
	
	
 Carreno said: ""This is what they are trying to accomplish through this campaign and their conduct, which is not that of journalists but of opposition activists, prompted the statement."" However, he did explain that he is more concerned about reports that Venezuela has relations with organizations categorized as terrorist by the Bush administration than he is about Powell's statement. He indicated: ""These reports have tried to suggest the existence of ties between Miraflores [Presidential Palace] and terrorist groups: There are documents presumably drafted by the FAN [National Armed Forces] expressing discontent with the government; the video disclosed by the journalists; and [Justice First Deputy] Gerardo Blyde's remarks on the creation of militia groups trained by the guerrillas. All this has sounded the alarm for the US Executive and suits the opposition's objectives to bring about an intervention or a blockade, which would hurt the people it claims to defend."" 
	
	
 Oddly, he defended the content of the video by affirming - as the President did - that this is evidence of a humanitarian action. He argued: ""When the United States has faced a situation involving extremist groups holding hostages, they have sent intermediaries to negotiate and no one has said that this shows they have relations with those groups."" 
	
	
 [Caracas El Nacional (Internet version) in Spanish on 7 February carries a related 760-word item that says that some opposition deputies agreed that the government's tactless actions are to blame for the concerns voiced by US Foreign Secretary Colin Powell. The report cites Convergence Deputy Alejandro Arzola saying that Powell's position clearly reflects the concern that exists in the international community and Latin America over the Venezuelan situation: the atmosphere of conflict and the threats against freedom of expression, democracy, and legal security. Arzola stated: ""The government's positions are not only harming the country at the domestic level, but also at the international level because thousands of investors are watching on their television sets what is happening in Venezuela, where the rule of law is under fire."" Arzola added: Any recommendation by a country friendly to Venezuela, especially a country that is Venezuela's No.1 trade partner, must be heeded, as well as recommendations by the Church and the nation, which is demanding a rectification. The report also cites Democratic Action leader Claudio Fermin, who warned: ""When Chavez came to the Presidency, the United States was buying 1.75 million barrels a day. At present, because of the misguided policy of cutting production, we are only selling them 1.1 million barrels. If to this, we add the President's constant aggressive attitude and readiness to establish ties between Venezuela and parasitic economies that give us nothing, but fulfill his political commitments, we will very likely continue to lose our edge in the US market."" According to Fermin, the chief of state still does not understand that if there is no confidence, there will be no investments. Movement Toward Socialism Deputy Julio Montoya stated: ""The national government has been extremely incompetent in handling relations with the United States. It has been vague about Venezuela's intentions regarding the protection of crude prices and the war on terrorism. Ambiguous situations constitute a breeding ground for bilateral tensions and the fact that currently, we do not even have an ambassador in Washington indicates that we are on the verge of a major breakdown in our relations with our leading trade partner.""]

Defense Minister Jose Vicente Rangel supports the position established by the Venezuelan foreign ministry to emphasize the government's sovereignty on international issues, referring to the statements given by US Secretary of State Colin Powell, questioning President Hugo Chavez Frias' activities. 
	
	
 ""I read General Colin Powell's statements and (Venezuelan Foreign Minister) Colonel [Luis Alfonso] Davila's statements, and I endorse Colonel Davila's statements,"" Rangel expressed. 
	
	
 Nevertheless, he wanted to clarify some of Powell's statements. Regarding ""Venezuela's friends,"" Rangel recalled that President Chavez is not the only one who visits those ""strange countries."" 
	
	
 ""For example, Mexican President Vicente Fox recently visited Cuba in a friendly manner; the government of Iran has been visited by high-ranking US representatives; and there is a relationship between the United States and Korea. We have yet to visit Korea and the relationship with Iraq and Libya is a result of the fact that both countries are OPEC members."" 
	
	
 Regarding ties with Colombian guerrilla groups, Rangel warned there ""is a clear elucidation; we are implementing a policy that was not even designed by President Chavez Frias. Our position is clear, we support no Latin American guerrilla group, much less the Colombian guerrilla groups, and what we want is for peace to prevail in that country."" 
	
	
 Likewise, the defense minister reiterated that ""the nation's position regarding terrorism is extremely clear, categorical, and decisive: Venezuela repudiates terrorism, not now but always; it does not endorse [terrorism] and considers [terrorism] an aberration that goes against mankind; and this is part of the current Venezuelan Government's ideology, philosophy, and policy."" 
	
	
 Rangel thinks Venezuela has shown effectiveness regarding issues of interest with the United States, above all regarding drug trafficking issues. ""We have confiscated 20 times more drugs in Venezuela than previous governments, and this is attested by the US authorities, with whom we have close contact."" 
	
	
 Where is the evidence? 
	
	
 Moreover, Rangel challenged parliamentary opposition to ""present the evidence regarding the purchase of that video,"" presented by journalists last week. 
	
	
 He said that he does not believe DIM [Military Intelligence Directorate] officials sold that video for 40 million bolivares, as stated by Opposition Bloc deputies. 
	
	
 Nevertheless, he does not rule out the possibility of going to the National Assembly and presenting a report if this is decided. ""Being an old parliamentarian, I love that activity and I would gladly go to Congress to provide an explanation. This is part of the democratic debate and, just as the opposition has rights, the government also has the right to provide an explanation."" 
	
	
 Consulted about Colombia's position, stating that the video issue has not been clarified, Rangel was emphatic when he said: ""The Venezuelan Government will provide sufficient details in a matter of hours.""

Venezuelan FAN [National Armed Forces] officers, non-commissioned officers and troops point out in a bulletin, which will begin to be circulated today [2 February], that the president seeks to destroy the military and ""substitute it with a socialist popular militia similar to that in Cuba."" 
	
	
 As a decade is about to have gone by since the 4 February [1992] coup attempt, a group of active soldiers requests, through a bulletin, the interdiction of President Hugo Chavez, as well as his immediate trial for alleged crimes against the res publica and the military institution. 
	
	
 Circulation of the 18-page document will begin today. It is primarily directed to the Venezuelans and also to ""all the free peoples of the world."" 
	
	
 Its adherents are 3,400 general, high-ranking and subordinate officers, professional career non-commissioned officers and professional military troops, whose signatures -- for their own security and that of their families and properties -- are deposited in the ABN AMOR Bank in Curacao and will be published in the media 72 hours after Chavez has left office. The document indicates that the FAN is an apolitical institution. It is, therefore, believed that the present situation represents a group of departures whose rectification is imperative. 
	
	
 Following a brief introduction, it recalls that on 4 February 1992 the now president violated his military oath when he rose up in arms against the democratic institutions. 
	
	
 ""He was defeated by the institutional Armed Forces, judged and retired (he had to be expelled) with dishonor from these, and the president, Doctor Rafael Caldera, dismissed his trial. This did not annul his expulsion from the Armed Forces through retirement, but it did revoke his legally corresponding sentence,"" says the bulletin. 
	
	
 Changes in the Military 
	
	
 The bulletin's authors recall that in 1958 a decentralizing process was begun within the military. This process originated the replacement of the General Staff with a Joint Chiefs of Staff. They point out that the concentration of command into a single entity is obsolete, ""it is obsolete, it does not work for deployments or in the preparation for these, nor for operations control, regardless of the area in which they are carried out."" 
	
	
 ""Now President Hugo Rafael Chavez Frias destroys what had been accomplished throughout more than half a century and intends to return to the obsolete military organization, not knowing the meaning of the duties of the organization, control and harmony organisms that military actions must have. The president's actions have no other objective than to destroy our traditional and glorious Armed Forces and, consequently substitute it with a socialist, popular militia, similar to that in Cuba,"" they add. 
	
	
 Further on, they criticize the authorization of Cuban militiamen to parade in the Carabobo camp, when they invaded [Venezuela] in the 1960's and backed an armed rebellion, for which Fidel Castro ""never apologized."" They revealed that Cuban soldiers piloted the MIG airplanes that flew over Caracas on 10 December. 
	
	
 The FN-30 rifle given to Castro, besides constituting a military crime, was seen as an act of submission. The weapon, they maintain, must be returned. 
	
	
 Friend of the Guerrillas 
	
	
 ""Hugo Rafael Chavez Frias is linked to the Colombian guerrillas that have damaged so much of their own country and periodically raid our territory, causing physical and material damages to our population,"" says the document. 
	
	
 Further on, it is stated that Jose Vicente Rangel's appointment was rejected within the FAN, not because he is a civilian, but because of his affinity toward Colombian rebel groups. 
	
	
 This official, ""expelled US personnel working under the Military Cooperation Agreement, signed in 1951 with the United States, from Fort Tiuna to please Fidel Castro. The agreement had arisen from the incorporation of Venezuela into the Loan and Lease System in 1941,"" they state. 
	
	
 They warn that distancing the United States risks the operational capability of the military units ""due to the lack of logistic support in the purchase of spare parts and all kinds of advising."" 
	
	
 Praetorian Promotion 
	
	
 According to the document's signing soldiers, the president is a true oligarch because he has even turned many of the members of his class at the Military Academy into a Praetorian Guard. 
	
	
 Chavez, they add, ""has demoralized and corrupted the Armed Forces through the prerogatives of an elite that discredits and kills the institution, taking away the will to react and defend institutionality from its officers."" 
	
	
 ""The president boasts that all the officers of the Armed Forces are committed to the 'revolution.' With this he intends to mean that military thought is subordinated to his own personal sentiments and ambition, thus dishonoring the constitution and laws. Furthermore, such boasts constitute a serious insult to the Armed Forces, which are committed only to the Republic and its democratic system."" 
	
	
 Disqualified 
	
	
 The document contends that Chavez's conduct is not in line with the majesty of a president. ""His intentions, his actions, his disguises, his demerits, his inability to judge, his changing and contradicting personality disqualify him from ruling over the destinies of the country, because his performances clearly show serious unbalanced states of mind, which expose all Venezuelans to national and international ridicule. 
	
	
 ""President Hugo Rafael Chavez Frias' is not a military pathology, but that of a man blinded by power, who believes himself to be the incarnation of our Liberator [Simon Bolivar]. The president veils his fears and traumas and seeks to hide behind a military uniform, which to the Venezuelan Armed Forces' misfortune, being dishonorable to it"" says the bulletin. 
	
	
 Another question refers to the oil supply to Cuba. The president would have exceeded his authority in giving to Cuba the returns from the export of oil. This would set the basis for a preliminary hearing. 
	
	
 The President to Court 
	
	
 To close, the central ideas of the active soldiers' document are condensed into 18 points. Outstanding among these are: 
	
	
 The FAN is apolitical and non-deliberating. This institution does not commit itself to the Chavez 'revolution.' They oppose the commemoration of military uprisings. Soldiers will never point their weapons at unarmed people The FAN is not responsible for the president's excesses. Chavez commits a crime by handling public funds as if they were his own. They will not allow the president to continue using military uniforms and insignia, nor directly [and single-handedly] give promotions. ""The Armed Forces of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela order all military personnel that is presently carrying out civilian duties to return to their respective units to carry out their corresponding military duties."" ""The Armed Forces of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela demand the interdiction of Hugo Rafael Chavez Frias as President of the Republic and thus the immediate cancellation of international treaties made by a disqualified president, in particular the agreements with Cuba, as well as the expelling of all Cubans that are presently working in Venezuela as physicians, advisors, trainers, etc."" They demand a stop to all agreements with China and trials for corrupt officers. They maintain that Chavez must be taken to trial for treason, embezzlement and for theft of military weaponry. They call on the civilian society to exercise its rights and kick Chavez out of power. 
	
	
 The FAN Is Manipulated 
	
	
 According to the bulletin, one of the most serious consequences of the president's attitude has to do with the decrease in the country's defense capabilities. The decision to decommission or relocate numerous Army and National Guard units is related to this. 
	
	
 ""Military morale is at stake due to a breakdown in discipline and the words and actions of the president in discrediting the officers, even to the point of forcing some high-ranking officers to make statements alien to them,"" it says. 
	
	
 The document warns that the president is not allowed to wear his military uniform. When he does so ""he disguises himself because he has ceased to be a soldier of the Fatherland and destroys the fundamental principles of subordination."" 
	
	
 He humiliates the higher-ranking officers by forcing them to receive him with full military honors under such conditions. This leads ""to a lack of discipline of the subordinates and exposure to public despise."" 
	
	
 Concerning Plan Bolivar 2000, the bulletin points out that Chavez has used the FAN for tasks that are not appropriate or that must only be carried out in cases of emergency. 
	
	
 [Chavez] diverts the functions of the Armed Forces with the irresponsible Plan Bolivar 2000, committing them to social action tasks that totally lack planning and administrative control. Corruption in the handling of funds, without audits, control nor sanction, with Mr. President's consent, is a result of his intentions of dismantling, destroying and demoralizing the Venezuelan Armed Forces,"" maintains the document. 
	
	
 We Are Poorly Paid 
	
	
 Those signing the document distanced themselves from those that state that Venezuelan society is going through a militarization process. ""We ask that the Venezuelan civilian society understand that in our country there is no militarism as such, only the appointment of retired officers that have recovered their civilian rights and under no context represent the Armed Forces. They are only out-and-out followers of President Hugo Rafael Chavez Frias."" 
	
	
 The authors make it clear that the retired soldiers have left behind their service to the military institution, be it by their own decision or forced by the circumstances. Therefore, they no longer have command. Only the right to a pension, ""established according to the earned wages, the obtained rank, the number of active years counted toward such a pension and the contributed amortization."" 
	
	
 ""The country would be badly militarized when 90 percent of the soldiers in public posts of the present administration are retired soldiers who, according to the constitution, have recovered 100 percent of their citizen rights. The rest of us soldiers have such right limited. Some members of the Venezuelan society, historians, philosophers, playwrights, journalists, artists and other free thinkers all think and state that militarism exists in Venezuela. They are so wrong and far from this reality. Nevertheless, it is true that many of these retired officers have dishonored the uniform, have been tried and, unfortunately for the nation, pardoned or their trial was dismissed, or the charges prescribed,"" they point out. 
	
	
 They denied that the FAN is an elitist institution though, according to themselves, about 30 percent of its members have completed at least two careers. 
	
	
 ""The statements on raises to salaries and wages of members of the Armed Forces by the president are false. The professional troops earn approximately 160,000 bolivars a month, close to the minimum wage. In general, the salaries of all the Armed Forces are the lowest of the civil service."" 
	
	
 They complained about the deficiencies of the benefits given to them through the National Armed Forces Social Welfare Institute (IPSFAN): insufficient mortgage loans, supermarkets that are not competitive enough in relation to others, etc. 
	
	
 ""Concerning the allocation of seniority (social benefits), a large proportion of the officer corps has had to request it prematurely to satisfy present needs because the salary is not enough, thus [economically] compromising their old age. There is practically no hospital medical attention for the members of the Armed Forces because military hospitals are being used to give service to the [civilian] population though Plan Bolivar 2000, instead of improving and increasing the capacity of the already existing [civilian] hospitals, clinics and outpatient departments."" 
	
	
 The declaration points out that the president has developed a sermon according to which the soldiers are the regime's beneficiaries. This is to generate ""antagonism"" within the public opinion. 
	
	
 ""This is the major fear that the president has imposed on the population every time he threatens it with the use of the Armed Forces to subjugate it,"" rounds off the bulletin. 
	
	
 They indicated that such a situation ""is now intolerable for the dignity of the Armed Forces.""

A 26 November 2001 article in Zhongguo Renkou Bao reported that in April 2001, the State Family Planning Commission initiated its transprovincial floating population investigation by surveying the marriage, birth, and birth control situations of 27,879 migrant women between the ages of 15 and 49. 
	
	
 Of the women surveyed, 87.2 percent (24,310) were married, higher than the national average of 82.3 percent (according to the 1997 National Population and Reproductive Health Survey). The average number of 15- to 19-year-old migrant women who are married with children is higher than the national average. The average for migrant women in the other age groups is lower than the national average. 
	
	
 Only about 30 percent of the migrant women who are married with two or more children have obtained official migrant population marriage documentation as required by the Procedures For Managing Floating Population Family Planning. This is less than the registration rate of migrant women with no or one child. 
	
	
 The percentage of married migrant women using contraceptives is 90.6 percent, higher than the national average of 83.4 percent. Moreover, those with children mostly use long-term contraceptive methods. The rate of using long-term contraceptive methods is higher among women with one son than women with one daughter. Those with two children mostly undergo sterilization. However, the use of sterilization among ""households with two daughters"" is significantly less than among households with at least one son.

CARACAS, Feb 7 (AFP) - Venezuelan Air Force Colonel Pedro Soto arrived outside the presidential residence late Thursday, leading thousands of opponents of President Hugo Chavez calling on Chavez to step down. 
	
	
 Tension escalated as around 100 Chavez supporters arrived at La Casona residence, in an exclusive district of eastern Caracas, around 11:30 pm (0330 GMT Friday), provoking fears of confrontations between the two sides. 
	
	
 ""We are here at the president's house, where a man sleeps every day, and we are waiting for him to tell us when he's going to resign, when he's going to call elections,"" Soto told reporters, adding that protesters would stay put until Chavez arrived. Chavez's whereabouts were unclear. 
	
	
 Soto had urged some 5,000 supporters to march on the presidential palace, in an earlier address from Altamira Square, saying he said he was going to demand Chavez's resignation. 
	
	
 But ruling Fifth Republic Movement (MVR) party lawmaker Nicolas Maduro also called on Venezuelans to go out into the streets to defend the Chavez government. 
	
	
 ""We invite the people of Caracas to go into the streets en masse and defend and support President Hugo Chavez and the revolutionary process,"" Maduro said, flanked by other MVR deputies. 
	
	
 And he accused the opposition of having put on a spectacle using Soto. 
	
	
 Earlier in the evening a crowd prevented a group of military police from arresting Soto, hours after he appeared at an event in a Caracas hotel, calling Chavez ""undemocratic"" and demanding the president's resignation. 
	
	
 Television images showed Soto fleeing his home, dressed in a civilian grey suit, in a red military vehicle with a driver. ""I'm fleeing from injustice and totalitarianism,"" Soto yelled to reporters. 
	
	
 Moments later the vehicle was stopped by military intelligence agents in Boyaca Avenue. 
	
	
 The group of officials designated to make the arrest appeared to have desisted, as dozens of Chavez opponents, including lawmakers, moved in to prevent Soto being taken away. 
	
	
 Interior Minister Ramon Rodriguez Chacin late Thursday guaranteed citizens' right to protest peacefully. 
	
	
 ""There is a right to express oneself and to demonstrate as long as it doesn't put people's property and state institutions at risk,"" the minister said from government headquarters at the Miraflores Palace. 
	
	
 ""People have the right to express themselves as long as it is in line with the law,"" Rodriguez Chacin said, but pointed the finger at Soto as a ""traitor"" and ""opportunistic leader."" 
	
	
 Shortly before Soto's arrival at the palace, presidential chief of staff Rafael Vargas said that ""total calm"" reigned in the nation, and underlined his belief that Soto's protest had been planned in advance by oligarchs. 
	
	
 ""We saw it coming, it's been timed to coincide with the visit by Organization of American States (OAS) representative Santiago Canton, to try and say that in Venezuela there's no freedom of expression,"" Vargas said. 
	
	
 Venezuela's Defense Minister Jose Vicente Rangel insisted there was ""absolute calm"" in the nation's barracks, denying rumors of mobilizing of troops. 
	
	
 However, he added that Soto would receive advice from a military attorney and two civilian lawyers before whom he would have to make a deposition about his critical opinions on Chavez's regime. 
	
	
 In a public event organized at a posh Caracas hotel earlier Thursday, Soto said 75 percent of Venezuelan officials and troops shared his view that Chavez should resign as president. 
	
	
 ""The president must go, he should resign, and before he does so, he should organize elections so that he leaves the country with a democracy, in the hands of a civilian,"" Soto boldly proclaimed at the ""pro-freedom"" forum. 
	
	
 ""A government in which the president controls the Supreme Court, the National Assembly and the Armed Forces cannot be called a democracy,"" Soto charged. 
	
	
 Soto said military discontent was running high because the armed forces were being used to Chavez' political ends. 
	
	
 He cited the government's Bolivar 2000 Plan which uses military staff and civilian crews for social projects. Soto called them ""outside the scope"" of the military's duty ""to protect national sovereignty."" 
	
	
 The harsh criticism of the populist former paratrooper Chavez by Soto came on the heels of an unusually blunt week of US criticism of the Venezuelan president. 
	
	
 US Secretary of State Colin Powell on Tuesday questioned Chavez' commitment to democracy and the war on terrorism and criticized his visits to countries like Iraq and Libya. Powell said Chavez was aware of the complaints. 
	
	
 And on Wednesday, Central Intelligence Agency director George Tenet told a Senate panel that he was worried about growing unrest in Venezuela, which is the United States' third largest supplier of crude oil.

If keeping Arafat captive, under siege with the Palestinian people by the Israeli occupying forces, is an affront to Palestinian, Arab dignity, and International justice, it is also a powder keg that will at one point explode, devastating what remains of the Israeli security. It is that same security that Sharon, the assassin, uses as an excuse to instigate struggles and wars, and promote instability. He also pretends that he besieges Arafat because so far, he was unable to confront the Palestinian resistance. 
	
	
 It is only natural, with the guerilla operations successively occur, even inside the fortified settlements, that the world begins to wonder whether the accusations that Arafat was planning, and instructing attacks on Israeli targets despite his captivity, and the round-the-clock Israeli surveillance, were founded. The only interpretation for these accusations is that Arafat has formidable supernatural powers that enable him to defend the rights of his homeland and people against the unlimited capabilities of the Israeli occupying forces equipped with all the mighty US weapon technology. 
	
	
 The failure of the US-made Israeli war machine to settle this unequal battle became clear in the farcical-yet-provocative, statements made by the Israeli minister of defense now present in Washington. He has called for helping aggressive Israel to put a traitorous agent at the head of the Palestinian Authority, who could accept its terms to ""assassinate' the rights of Palestinians. 
	
	
 It is certain the Ben Eliezer's hallucination is a mere expression of failure to persuade the world to accept the brutality of the occupying forces' practices. They even embody the bankrupt policy of Israeli criminal extremism and failure to gain legitimacy for its continuing occupation of the Palestinian territories. 
	
	
 Ben Eliezer's raving coincided with the arrival of his assassin boss Sharon to Washington to take part in exerting pressures on the US administration, and persuade it that removing Arafat could bring about the Palestinian surrender, and halt violence as he calls it. Sharon and Ben Eliezer never stopped to consider that no patriotic Palestinian could accept to serve as a substitute agent to Israel. They, along with the extremist gang in the Israeli government, do not want to understand that Arafat symbolizes the Palestinian struggle. With this attitude, Sharon's government showed its true hostility for a leader and chairman elected by his people. US peace Envoy Burns has expressed this after his meeting with president Mubarak. He has declared that US contacts will continue with Arafat considering that he is the elected Palestinian chairman. 
	
	
 I do wish that Burns's statements reflect a true position that signals a return of balance to the US position in dealing with the reality of Palestinian-Israeli struggle. 
	
	
 The time has come, gentlemen, for Sharon, the assassin, to realize that injustice cannot last long. The security of the Israelis depends on the Palestinians' regaining their rights. By besieging Arafat, Sharon has turned him into the ""Mandela"" of Arab struggle. This foretells that the Israeli occupation's claims will inevitably falls, no matter how long Sharon humiliates Arab dignity, relaying on the protection and support of Washington, which forgot all principles and role in defending justice, and international legitimacy.

[Headline of editorial] By Adbolhassan Sobhani ""Pot Calling the Kettle Black"" 
	
	
 Addressing Friday worshippers gathered at Tehran University, Iran's former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani on Friday criticized the treatment of Taleban and Al-Qa'idah prisoners in Guantanamo military base in Cuba. The former president and current chairman of the Expediency Council said that these prisoners are put in chain, in cages in summer and in winter. He said that the Americans are treating these prisoners like ""an ostrich"". They neither believe that these prisoners are truly prisoners, nor do they believe that they are ""captives."" After pointing its finger of blame at tens of regimes and governments around the world for decades. Washington needs to review its own history of crimes against humanity, especially the non-WASP humanity. What is non-WASP humanity? Non-White Anglo-Saxon-Protestant humanity is that part of humanity whose eyes are not bluest of the blue and whose hair is not blondest of the blonde. According to Americans, this sort of humanity does not qualify for any of the laws that have been legislated by international organizations, by any accepted world conventions. (John Walker, ""the American Taleban"" has not been taken to Guantanamo because he is not part of the non-WASP humanity). The treatment of Al-Qa'idah and Taleban prisoners will go down in history as the most shameful detentions in the history of post-war incarceration in the 21st century. The US President George W. Bush has said that he does not recognize the detainees in Guantanamo military base as war captives, and hence he will not accord them the rights and privileges that they would automatically get under Geneva Convention. The argument by Bush is that these detainees are members of a terrorist group and hence they do not qualify as members of a defeated country or an army. Even if we assume that George W. Bush has a point in making this argument, it is not up to him to decide who is a captive or who is not a captive. An international tribunal consisting of experts on international law should decide on this issue, not Mr. Bush whose knowledge of international law leaves plenty to be desired. The world is watching how the US is treating the detainees in Guantanamo. The world well remembers how the United States has been calling other countries as violators of human rights, while it has been involved in one of the grossest type of human rights violations. The case of the United States is like the case of that pot who called the kettle black. If the United States is truly committed to human rights, it should show it in its treatment of the detainees that it has transported in chain to another side of the globe. This is in no way defending the Taleban or the Al-Qa'idah members, some of whom might be guilty of the most heinous crimes against the poor oppressed people in Afghanistan. The point is that if the United States keeps pontificating and preaching about human rights, it can't suddenly forget about its past lectures to other countries and nations. [end]

Spanish daily blasts ""meaningless"" US announcement on Guantanamo detainees 
	
	
 Text of unsigned editorial headlined ""The USA tramples on the rights of all the Guantanamo prisoners"" published by Spanish newspaper El Mundo web site on 9|February 
	
	
 The White House spokesman announced the night before last that the Taleban prisoners being held in Guantanamo will enjoy the treatment envisaged under the Geneva Convention, but not the foreign prisoners from Al-Qai'dah, who the Bush administration considers terrorists. The Geneva Convention is the international treaty signed in 1949 by the USA and other countries, which regulates the treatment of prisoners of war and grants them a set of legal and humanitarian rights. Bush's spokesman added that none of the 158 detainees in Guantanamo is going to be given prisoner-of-war status, which makes the apparently positive part of the White House statement meaningless. The USA refuses to admit that these detainees are prisoners of war because, under the Convention, they would have the right not to answer any questions except to give their name and rank, they could not be tried except for war crimes and they would have to be repatriated after the war ends. So when the White House says it is going to treat the Taleban in accordance with the Geneva Convention, it is pure rhetoric, nothing other than a public relations exercise and will be meaningless in practice. The key issue is not so much whether they are treated humanely and their beliefs respected, but their legal status. If they don't enjoy the advantages of being prisoners of war and do not have the right to be tried under US criminal law, what jurisdiction will be used for these men being held incommunicado in a place that isn't the USA or Cuba? Nobody in the US government has answered this question, even though international organizations like the Red Cross and Human Rights Watch have denounced the defenceless situation of these prisoners, who have no access to lawyers and do not enjoy the minimum guarantees for judicial proceedings which, in their case, do not exist. Donald Rumsfeld and other senior Washington officials have tried to justify what is happening in Guantanamo on the grounds that the detainees are dangerous terrorists. That may be the case, but even the worst criminals have the right to a lawyer and to know the charges against them. It can only be paradoxical that a supposedly model democracy like the USA can trample on the law to such an extent.

KABUL, Feb 10 (AFP) - Interim Afghan leader Hamid Karzai is to travel to the United Arab Emirates on Sunday, completing visits to the three countries that recognized the Taliban regime before September 11. 
	
	
 Kabul announced the Afghan embassy in Islamabad would reopen next week after Karzai's historic fence-mending visit to Pakistan on Friday. He has also made an official trip to Saudi Arabia. 
	
	
 In another step to heal festering wounds, Karzai on Saturday pardoned 350 captured Taliban soldiers, saying they were ""innocent"" and part of a general amnesty that allowed foot-soldiers to go free. 
	
	
 But the Afghan interim government branded Mullah Abdul Wakil Mutawakel, the Taliban foreign minister who surrendered to US forces in Kandahar Friday, as a war criminal who should be put on trial. 
	
	
 Taliban leaders ""created misery for our people. The world has suffered because of what they did ... They deserve justice and to be treated as war criminals because they supported terrorism,"" Interim Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah said. 
	
	
 One of the closest aides to reclusive Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar, he is seen as a potential source of crucial evidence against Omar and bin Laden, the chief suspect of the September 11 terror attacks who has eluded a US-led manhunt so far. 
	
	
 The United States meanwhile brought another 34 al-Qaeda and Taliban captives to a detention camp on a US naval base on Cuba Saturday, bringing the total of detainees held there to 220. 
	
	
 The new arrivals were dressed in standard-issue zippered orange jumpsuits. Because each was bound and shackled, the blue jackets they wore on the 27-hour flight were removed by scissors-wielding US troops as the prisoners descended from the plane into the tropical heat. 
	
	
 In Geneva the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it and Washington were at odds over Washington's decision not to recognise captured Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters as prisoners of war. 
	
	
 ""There are divergent views between the US and the ICRC on the procedures which apply on how to determine that the persons detained are not entitled to prisoner of war status,"" the ICRC said in a statement. 
	
	
 ""The US and the ICRC will pursue their dialogue on this issue."" 
	
	
 US President George W. Bush decided Thursday that the 1949 Geneva Conventions would apply to captured Taliban fighters taken from Afghanistan to a US military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, but not to al-Qaeda members there. 
	
	
 However, Washington said that neither group would be accorded prisoner of war status. 
	
	
 Concern also continued over signs that the US was expanding its war on terror to other countries. 
	
	
 While taking care to avoid directly criticizing Bush, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said it was unrealistic to see the world in terms of good and evil states. 
	
	
 In an interview published by the Swiss daily newspaper Blick on Saturday, Annan was asked about Bush's statement describing Iran, Iraq and North Korea as part of an ""axis of evil."" 
	
	
 Annan said, without specifically mentioning the US: ""You can not divide the world between the good and the evil, because between them there are shades of gray."" 
	
	
 EU commissioner Chris Patten, also speaking in a newspaper interview, accused Bush's administration of a dangerously ""absolutist and simplistic"" stance. 
	
	
 It was time European governments spoke up and stopped Washington before it went into ""unilateralist overdrive"", he told the British newspaper The Guardian. 
	
	
 In Ottawa, the Group of Seven industrialized nations called for intensified efforts to freeze terrorist financing and reported that at least 100 million dollars had been frozen since September 11. 
	
	
 ""Significant results have already been achieved,"" said the final communique of finance ministers of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. 
	
	
 ""Since September 11, almost 150 countries and jurisdictions have issued orders to freeze terrorist assets and over 100 million dollars has been frozen worldwide,"" it said after the two-day gathering in Ottawa and in nearby Quebec. 
	
	
 In another sign of progress in cracking terrorist networks, court sources in Paris said an Islamic militant under investigation for an alleged plot to attack the French city of Strasbourg had admitted meeting two other terrorist suspects at a training camp in Afghanistan. 
	
	
 Yacine Akhnouche, arrested Monday, told police he had met suspected shoe bomber Richard Reid and Zacarias Moussaoui at a training camp in Afghanistan in 2000, during one of several stays in the country. 
	
	
 Moussaoui, a Frenchman of Moroccan descent, is the first person charged in connection with the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington. 
	
	
 Reid, a British national, was arrested after allegedly trying to light a fuse attached to explosives in his shoes while on a Paris to Miami flight on December 22. 
	
	
 Karzai meanwhile continued to wrestle with security problems as rival warlords tried to fill the power vacuum left by the fall of the Taliban. 
	
	
 On Saturday he met representatives of two warlords who clashed violently last week over who should be governor in eastern Paktia province. 
	
	
 ""This is a very serious matter and Karzai wanted himself to be involved in finding a solution,"" Deputy Border Affairs Minister Mirza Ali told AFP. 
	
	
 Fifty people were killed in a two-day battle when Karzai's appointed governor, Padsha Khan, sent his forces to secure the governor's house in the provincial capital Gardez. 
	
	
 They were driven out by rival warlord Saif Ullah, who has refused to give up power. 
	
	
 Karzai has blamed Khan for the fighting and said it was ""one more reason why we should finish warlordism in this country."" 
	
	
 The clash has called into question Karzai's ability to govern beyond the Kabul area and bolstered his appeal for the deployment of more international troops in his country. 
	
	
 The search for kidnapped US journalist Daniel Pearl stretched into its 18th day in Pakistan with no sign of the Wall Street Journal correspondent, who was abducted while researching a story on Islamic militancy.

Bush's ""axis of evil"" is convenient electoral tool - Portuguese paper 
	
	
 Text of article by Caio Blinder, ""Politics put in order"", by Portuguese newspaper Diario de Noticias web site on 10|February 
	
	
 In this week's address to Congress, US Secretary of State Colin Powell dismissed the criticisms of President Bush's rhetoric, which emerged after the president pinned the tag ""axis of evil"" on countries such as Iraq, Iran and North Korea during his State of the Union address. It was surely not just rhetoric. George W. Bush is no master of eloquence and his speeches are extremely well prepared. The president is not a man who likes to improvise. The expression is undoubtedly strong and well thought out. America has not seen such a bellicose president since Ronald Reagan, who, in 1983, referred to the Soviet Union as the ""evil empire"". In some European capitals there are rumours that Bush is defining his doctrine based on the war against terror but also as an excuse to pursue another unilateral offensive. The USA has proclaimed the right to attack countries which do not cooperate in a campaign that the president has said is taking place between civilization and barbarity. It sounds clumsy to place North Korea, Iran and Iraq in the same axis as if they were Nazi Germany, Hirohito's Japan and Mussolini's Italy. In fact, those three countries do share a hatred for the USA, but why has Saudi Arabia not been included on the same list, since that country has always been a sponsor of Islamic fundamentalism? Colin Powell will have trouble wriggling out of the need to explain and justify the president's vision. The defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, a man becoming more powerful by the day, is perfectly at ease with the rhetorical petards hurled by the commander-in-chief. They prove that the USA is gradually adopting an offensive rather than a defensive stance in its strategy. Nevertheless, the White House's offensive also has a domestic dimension. To paint a dark picture of the threats facing the American empire may prove crucial at a time when the government is about to announce its state budget proposals, the cornerstone of which involves one of the largest increases of the last 20 years in the Pentagon's budget. The Democrats continue to close ranks behind the president on the war against terrorism, and to mention an ""axis of evil"" could help strengthen an atmosphere of national unity that would suit the president when he announces other points in his budget policy with which not everyone might agree. President Bush is insisting on cutting taxation on corporations and the richest Americans, at the same time as money for social programmes is drying up. Bush is launching a new budget deficit era: it would be easier for him to sell his proposals under a period of belt-tightening and national security concerns. The deeper the international crisis, the better for George Bush. Things may even get better for him in the event of the crisis dragging on until 2004, when he will probably try to be re-elected. Until then, it is not certain that the USA will attack Iraq, Iran or North Korea, but the concept of the ""axis of evil"" will surely be on the president's lips for some time. It concerns a genuine threat but it is a convenient electoral tool too.

Hanoi, Feb. 9 (VNA) -- Vietnam and the United States will organize a scientific conference on human health and the environmental effects of Agent Orange/Dioxins in Hanoi's Daewoo Hotel from Mar. 3-6. 
	
	
 According to the National Institute of Environment and Health Sciences (NIEHS) of the US, the conference will offer scientists worldwide opportunities to exchange scientific information on the effects of Agent Orange/Dioxins on human health and the environment and discuss measures to reduce the hazards of this toxic chemical. Scientists will evaluate available dioxin-related research results and define present requirements for further research. 
	
	
 NIEHS said that the conference will mark the start of joint scientific research on the impact of defoliant sprayed by the US Air Force during the war in Vietnam. It is expected to lay a foundation for further bilateral cooperation projects in this field as well as seeking funding for future projects. 
	
	
 According to unofficial reports, between 1961 and 1971, US aircraft sprayed 72 million liters of toxic chemicals, including 44 million liters of Agent Orange, containing 170 kg of dioxin, in Vietnam. Dioxin is an extremely poisonous chemical that causes cancer, immune system malfunction and birth defects. 
	
	
 When the US war ended in 1975, three million Vietnamese had been killed, 4.4 million wounded and two million affected by toxic chemicals, mainly Agent Orange. In the first decade after the war, about 50,000 children were born with deformities or paralysis to parents affected by toxic chemicals.

Kenya: ""Highly contagious"" type of tuberculosis reported in Embu 
	
	
 Text of report by Kenyan newspaper Daily Nation web site on 11|February 
	
	
 An outbreak of a highly contagious type of tuberculosis has been reported in Embu [central Kenya]. Health authorities said yesterday that more than 27 people had tested positive for the severe sputum smear type of tuberculosis. A TB expert, Dr Joel Kangangi, said one person infected with the bacteria could spread it to more than 10 people in a day. The doctor, however, said no deaths had been reported. The worst affected areas are Dallas, Majengo and the Shauri Yako slums with a population of 17,000 people. Dr Kangangi, an assistant director of medical services attached to the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Programme, said 56 per cent of those infected with TB were also HIV-positive. Health personnel have been deployed to the affected areas to carry out random screening of residents to contain the outbreak. Yesterday, Dr Kangangi carried out random checks on hundreds of residents in Dallas estate. He was accompanied by the Embu Medical Officer of Health, Dr Nicholas Muraguri, and a team of health personnel. The medic blamed the outbreak on congestion in the slums and failure to observe basic hygienic practices. The residents are being advised to ensure that their houses were well ventilated to avoid multiplication of germs. They are also being advised to seek medical attention immediately they detect symptoms of the disease. The symptoms include prolonged cough, chest pains, fever and loss of weight and appetite.

The government got through the first day of transactions on the floating foreign exchange market without too many difficulties. After a week-long currency holiday and to the surprise of many, the dollar hit only 2.4 pesos and closed at 2.1, with no need for intervention by the Central Bank. 
	
	
 The average prices at exchange offices had the dollar closing yesterday at 1.85 bid and 2.15 asked. On the wholesale market, however, the dollar closed at 2 bid and 2.03 asked. The exchange rate on the retail market, which started at between 2.3 and 2.4 pesos, fell sharply in the early afternoon hours after some exporters began settling their positions. 
	
	
 ""Exporters held out until they saw that the dollar would not top 2.4. At that point they started selling, and the exchange rate fell back to 1.75,"" one trader said. Also pushing the dollar down were the restrictions that still exist on the foreign exchange market and the scant trading liquidity. 
	
	
 Yesterday was also the first day that holders of salary direct-deposit accounts were able to access all their money. Although theoretically this threatened to increase the amount of money in circulation, it did not because of the shortage of pesos at many automatic tellers around the city. ""Buying dollars for more than 2 pesos is not a good deal,"" said Alfredo Piano, the head of the company that bears his name. Meanwhile, economist Miguel Bein, a former secretary of economic policy, said that ""the overshooting already happened when the dollar went from 1 to 2 pesos. As was to be expected, people did not want to support prices beyond 2.15 pesos to the dollar."" 
	
	
 Not all banks refrained from selling greenbacks, though. After deciding that it would take in all of the dollars in the banks' possession, the Central Bank decided late Friday to suspend the order. Thus, some mid-sized private banks moved into the retail foreign currency market. 
	
	
 ""There are still no regulations. The Central Bank has not yet explained what transfers can be made or what the authorization rules will be for these transactions. Until it does so, the wholesale market, which is the one that can stand up to the Central Bank, is going to remain closed,"" explained one trader at a front-line bank. 
	
	
 ""The calm was due to the fact that there were no importers around, because they do not have authorization,"" said Jorge Fogwill of Scotiabank Quilmes. ""If there are no importers, the market has no reason to heat up, and as long as this continues, there will be no need for the Central Bank to intervene,"" he added. 
	
	
 Traders are expecting as calm a session today as yesterday, at least until the Central Bank decides to spell out which transfers it will authorize in the future. 
	
	
 Atmosphere Heats up in Financial District Exchange Offices 
	
	
 The boards at exchange offices were again the focus of greatest attention in the Buenos Aires financial district. Thousands of people turned the corner of Sarmiento and San Martin, where most of the agencies are concentrated, into a pedestrian mall. 
	
	
 As if they were strolling through a shopping center, savers peered into exchange office windows, looking for the best price. Only after walking up and down several blocks and comparing the quotes did people get in line and endure the midday heat to buy or sell the coveted greenback. 
	
	
 The people in these lines were in a foul mood. ""To sell dollars I have to stand in this line for two hours or so,"" shouted Alberto, a laboratory executive. Three persons who were standing near him immediately asked him, almost in unison, at what price he was willing to sell. This was a common scene, as savers could avoid long lines this way. 
	
	
 Miguel, an unemployed man from Entre Rios, offered another way to avoid the wait. For five pesos he would stand in line while his ""customer"" had a soft drink or took care of other business. 
	
	
 The presence of the crowd prompted occasional passers-by to express animated opinions and engage in almost philosophical debates about conditions in the country. ""Great, keep on buying dollars so there'll be more and more poor people in the country,"" shouted one. ""What do you want them to do when no one believes in the peso anymore,"" came the reply. 
	
	
 Unauthorized street traders flourished, expecting to make a killing. But the Federal Police cleared the area. In an operation that morning they arrested 12 illegal currency traders near Corrientes and San Martin. The police presence did not stop them from seeking out savers, however. ""I'm not sure whether I should wait in line or sell to one of the street traders, because they'll even give me a few cents more,"" said Fabian, a 36-year old attorney. 
	
	
 As if the crowd and people's nerves were already not enough to heat up the atmosphere, at noon a march by the Argentine Production Movement and the demonstrations against banks wound up scaring away several savers, who decided to conduct their transactions another day. ""You can't live with this level of hysteria,"" said Jorge, a 67-year old retiree who in all his years cannot recall a comparable situation. 
	
	
 Weak Dollar Sends Merval Index Down 10.68 Percent 
	
	
 The Buenos Aires Stock Exchange's Merval index fell 10.68 percent on the first day of the single foreign exchange market. Shares fell as prices corrected vis-a-vis the exchange rate of the dollar. 
	
	
 Some specialists felt that the peso's appreciation against the dollar triggered a wave of selling on the stock market as the share prices set in accordance with a higher exchange rate than the one now drooped. They also explained that the stock market's behavior would be hard to predict in the coming days since it will depend mainly on the greenback; as a result, many are saying that there will be ""upward and downward price swings."" 
	
	
 In a session that traders described as ""wait and see,"" trading volume hit 32.6 million pesos. The board showed 25 stocks lower, 11 higher, and 5 unchanged. 
	
	
 Among the biggest losers were Acindar (down 14.88 percent), Banco Frances (down 13.68 percent), Perez Companc (down 11.31 percent), and Telecom Argentina (down 10.96 percent). Among the strongest gainers were Gas Natural Ban (up 12.7 percent), Banco Bansud (up 7.69 percent), Instituto Rosembusch (up 4 percent), and Sociedad Comercial del Plata (up 2.7 percent). 
	
	
 The Merval index moved as expected at the start of a week in which the dollar did not change much in spite of the major uncertainty caused by the return of the single foreign exchange market after 11 years when one peso equaled one dollar. 
	
	
 Trends 
	
	
 Last Wednesday the Merval index posted a sharp 5.94 percent rise when the stock exchange reopened. At that point investors were anticipating a possible jump in the dollar when the currency market reopened. 
	
	
 Yesterday, however, the Merval closed down sharply at 410.84, in keeping with the trend over the past two days. 
	
	
 The stock market had anticipated a dollar exchange rate that did not come about. Therefore, investors began selling their shares, which prompted a sharp drop in the Merval index. 
	
	
 According to analysts, the trend in the stock market is closely linked to the price of the dollar. Hence, when investors saw that the dollar was trading at between 1.9 and 2.3 pesos, they began selling off their shares to make as much profit as they could. 
	
	
 In the view of Leopoldo Oilvari Sivori of Bacque Sociedad de Bolsa, ""the behavior of the stock market is linked to the exchange rate. Last week it rose because we had different expectations about the value of the dollar, but today it is correcting the 20 or 30 cents that the dollar is down."" He went on to say that the investors who bought shares in recent months start selling as quickly as possible when they see that the dollar exchange rate is not what they expected. 
	
	
 In addition, exporters have started settling their pending transactions. According to traders, ""in this way the market got liquidity and pushed prices lower."" 
	
	
 Investors saw equities as a way of hedging against a possible rise in the dollar. But when the greenback failed to achieve its expected value, investors who bought shares at a specific price started selling to earn some spread before the dollar could go lower. 
	
	
 Last Friday the Merval index closed down a marginal 0.32 percent after a session that traders had predicted would be calm. 
	
	
 Some specialists feel that ""anything could happen"" this week, but the trend is downward.

The European Union, which is historically and geographically more closer to the Middle East than the United States, had to make a move after the Europeans ran out of patience toward the worsening US stand that supports the Israeli right-wing policies. 
	
	
 The United States pressured the weaker side, the Palestinians, who are under occupation and subjected to repressive Israeli measures, including assassinations, arrests, incursions into cities, demolition of hundreds of homes, and uprooting of thousands of trees. The United States, which is pleased with Israel, did not see these Israeli practices and instead focused its attention on the Palestinians' reactions that were generated by the Israeli provocations. 
	
	
 Meanwhile, a European initiative, launched by all the European Union members, gradually began to take shape. Spain and France, which were at the forefront, led an intensive media drive to highlight what is actually happening in the Palestinian territories and extricate the peace process from the stalemate. 
	
	
 The peace process was deadlocked as a result of the oppressive Israeli military campaign against the Palestinian nationalistic move and Israel's insistence on suspending the political negotiations and focusing on military actions to subjugate the Palestinian people and liquidate their legitimate rights and aspirations. 
	
	
 Perhaps the most important characteristic of the new European initiative is the fact that it annuls the hardline Israeli-US stand, which rejects any kind of political negotiations unless the violence stops completely. 
	
	
 The Europeans were in the right when they emphasized that this unrealistic stand brought the peace process to a deadlock and plunged the Palestinians and Israelis into an endless cycle of violence. Therefore, the political negotiations should be resumed ahead of any effort aimed at achieving a peace acceptable to both sides. 
	
	
 The European plan is sensible because it calls for setting up a Palestinian state in the territories that were seized in 1967 in line with the international resolutions provided that the Israeli side officially agrees to this move. 
	
	
 Under this plan, the negotiations should focus on a mechanism for Israel's withdrawal from the occupied territories, ending the settlement activity, finding a just solution to the issue of Palestinian refugees, and allowing time to reorganize the Palestinian house from within with a view to achieving democracy and introducing a multi-party system. The Palestinian leadership and President Yasir Arafat welcomed this plan a few weeks ago. 
	
	
 There is no doubt whatsoever that the Palestinian people welcome and support the new European initiative because it is bold and fair and seeks to revive the peace process on realistic and just bases. This initiative is not partial. It does not turn a blind eye to the Israeli practices, occupation, and settlement activity and dismisses the notion of punishing the wronged Palestinian people who have been deprived of all their national and human rights. 
	
	
 This initiative disapproves of the flimsy pretexts to increase the Palestinians' suffering and encourage the Israeli right-wing stands, which is what the US Administration has been doing lately. 
	
	
 The European initiative will serve as a test of not only Israel's intentions toward the peace process that are known for being negative, but also as a test of the US stand. This initiative will show whether the United States will give up its complete and blind bias toward Israel in order to achieve a just solution restoring the Palestinian people's legitimate rights and guaranteeing peace, security, and stability for all nations in the region.

Washington, February 11 (XINHUA) -- US Senate Majority leader Tom Daschle criticized on Monday President George W. Bush for his remarks that described Iran, Iraq and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) as ""axis of evil"". 
	
	
 In an interview on PBS' ""The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer,"" Daschle said Bush's remarks were wrong. ""I think we've got to be very careful with the rhetoric of that kind,"" he said. 
	
	
 Daschle's criticism was the first from a leading Democrat since Bush delivered his State of the Union address to Congress in which he used the word of ""axis of evil"" to label Iran, Iraq and the DPRK. 
	
	
 Bush's description of Iran, Iraq and DPRK as ""axis of evil"" has courted strong criticism from the three countries as well as some of its allies. 
	
	
 But Daschle also saw the three countries as threats to the United States, saying that Bush was ""right in calling attention to the danger they pose to the United States."" 
	
	
 ""I think that it's important for us to look at each of these countries as threats to this country clearly, as problems that we' ve got to address clearly"", he said.

ISTANBUL, Feb 12 (A.A) - While the sessions continue within the framework of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC)-European Union (EU) Joint Forum, the preparatory works of the joint declaration expected to be released following the forum also continue. 
	
	
 Diplomatic sources told A.A correspondent on Tuesday that how the Middle East issue would take place in the joint declaration was the main agenda of the deliberations. 
	
	
 Turkey, which pays attention to remain neutral in the deliberations as the host country, does not take an active role in the deliberations held by the EU and OIC officials. 
	
	
 Sources said that while Islam countries request that Israel be harshly condemned in the joint declaration for its policy towards Palestine, the EU side thinks that this issue should be mentioned but a more cautious stance should be assumed. 
	
	
 A high-level official told A.A correspondent that Turkey had not taken an active role in those deliberations so far but that it was ready to intervene if the two sides did not reach a compromise. 
	
	
 Meanwhile, the same official said that he did not agree with the comments that the Forum was ``OIC-EU front against the United States.`` The official noted that the forum was organized to prevent the probability of conflicts of civilizations that had come to the agenda after September 11. To this end, the official said, the forum did not aim to create new disagreements. 
	
	
 Palestinian Foreign Minister Farouk Kaddoumi, who is also attending the forum, called on Monday that Israel should be harshly condemned in the joint declaration to be issued at the end of the forum.

Italian farmer charged with illegally slaughtering cattle 
	
	
 Text of report in English by Italian news agency ANSA web site 
	
	
 Benevento, 13 February: A 67-year-old farmer from Benevento near Naples was arrested today on charges of illegally slaughtering cattle. The man was caught by police while secretly slaughtering a cow at his farm. The meat was confiscated and will be tested to see if it is contaminated with ""mad cow"" disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Police stressed they had stepped up farm inspections across the region of Campania amid heightened concern over illegal slaughtering practices in the wake of Italy's first suspected case of vCJD - the fatal brain-wasting human form of BSE. The case concerns a 23-year-old woman from Menfi in southwest Sicily whom health officials said last week had almost certainly contracted the disease in Italy and at least five years ago. Federico Piccoli, a top neurologist at Palermo hospital who is helping to treat the woman, immediately warned that further cases of vCJD in Sicily were only to be expected because ""the illegal slaughter of animals still goes on here"". His comments were immediately contested by meat industry representatives and vet associations but the opposition Green party said yesterday there was evidence that illegal slaughtering practices were on the rise in several southern regions such as Campania, Sicily and Puglia and that the meat was entering the food chain. Italy launched a BSE cattle-testing programme in January 2001, in compliance with European Union regulations, and so far 56 cases of ""mad cow"" disease have been detected.

KHARTOUM, Feb 13 (AFP) - Sudanese rebels have released a group of fishermen they had held for the last six months after charging that their boat belonged to the Sudanese government army, their employer said Wednesday. 
	
	
 Salmah Trading and Investment Company said its fishermen, who were captured last August while fishing in the Fangak area in south Sudan's Upper Nile region, were set free Tuesday by the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). 
	
	
 ""The release was due to tremendous efforts by the citizens who benefit from the company's services,"" the company said in a statement received by AFP, without elaborating further. The statement did not indicate the exact number of the freed fishermen but an official of the company said they were originally 11 in number. 
	
	
 The Sudanese government had always denied that the boat belonged to the army. The rebels released the boat shortly after the fishermen were captured. 
	
	
 The private trading company said in its statement that it would continue with its services ""for the benefit of the people of southern Sudan."" 
	
	
 Sudan's civil war has raged since 1983 when the SPLA took up arms in a bid to end domination of the mainly Christian and animist south by the Islamic government in the north.

 Seoul, Feb. 14 (Yonhap) -- North Korea will be one of the key agenda items for U.S. President George W. Bush during consecutive stops in Tokyo, Seoul and Beijing from Feb. 17-22, diplomatic experts said Thursday. 
	
	
 Bush's Asian trip was initially scheduled for October last year but was delayed due to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States and subsequent U.S.-led war in Afghanistan. 
	
	
 The North Korea issue flared up after Bush labeled North Korea, Iran and Iraq an ""axis of evil"" in his Jan. 29 State of Union address, taking issue with their alleged attempts to secure weapons of mass destruction. 
	
	
 Seoul, Tokyo, Beijing and Washington all have interests in resolving the North Korea issue. 
	
	
 The Feb. 20 talks between President Kim Dae-jung and Bush will focus on U.S. charges that the North is developing weapons of mass destruction for export to other ""rogue"" nations. 
	
	
 The two leaders will also address North Korea's conventional military posture, while reconfirming their traditional cooperation in dealing with North Korea. 
	
	
 North Korea will also likely come up when Bush meets Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and Chinese President Jiang Zemin. 
	
	
 In a related development, the Seoul government reportedly decided to resume talks with North Korea to deliver the concerns of the United States and the international community about its weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons. 
	
	
 The decision apparently aims to make Seoul the primary negotiator in talks with Pyongyang. During the Kim-Bush summit, the Kim administration will convey its plans to the United States. 
	
	
 Bush's Asian trip could serve as a turning point for his government's North Korea policy. 
	
	
 North Korea has likened Bush's ""axis of evil"" remark to a declaration of war. Afterwards, Bush's aides downplayed the severity of Bush's words, saying the administration seeks negotiations with the North, not war. 
	
	
 In addition, Bush will discuss ways to further the three countries' support for the U.S.-led anti-terrorism campaign and extend its mission beyond Afghanistan. 
	
	
 This will be Bush's first visit to Seoul since his inauguration early last year and his third meeting with President Kim. The two met in Shanghai last October and in Washington last March. 
	
	
 While in Tokyo from Sunday to Tuesday, Bush is likely to support Koizumi's economic reform efforts and express U.S. willingness to help Japan regain its economic vitality. 
	
	
 Visiting China Feb. 21-22, Bush and Jiang will address follow-up steps for China's recent entry into the World Trade Organization and the struggle against AIDS, besides the North Korea issue.

 Nagoya, Feb. 15 Kyodo -- Romanian President Ion Iliescu toured a Toyota Motor Corp. plant in Toyota, Aichi Prefecture, on Friday, the last day of his four-day stay in Japan.

 The plant produces 14,000 units monthly of Toyota's Crown and other luxury cars, as well as hybrid electric-gasoline autos including the Prius. 
	
	
 Iliescu met with Shoichiro Toyoda, honorary Toyota chairman, and Fujio Cho, president of Japan's largest automaker.

Washington has expressed concern to the Lebanese authorities about the possibility of a Hizbullah attack against Israel within the next couple of days, and requested that efforts be deployed to prevent such a development, official sources disclosed Friday. 
	
	
 The sources said an American message was delivered to the Foreign Ministry on Friday regarding the Bush administration's claims that Hizbullah was contemplating a new military operation to mark the anniversary of the assassination of then-Hizbullah secretary-general Abbas Mussawi. 
	
	
 Mussawi was killed on Feb. 17, 1992, when an Israeli helicopter fired a missile into his car in the South. According to the sources, US fears were based on Israeli information about such a likelihood. 
	
	
 Security sources said that Israel had reinforced security measures along the Lebanese-Israeli border over the past couple of days, having adopted a series of ""precautionary procedures."" For that purpose, Israeli troops were deployed en masse along the border over the last 48 hours, the security sources said. 
	
	
 Lebanese officials have avoided publicly commenting on the new message from Washington. But the sources reaffirmed that Lebanon remained committed to its position regarding the situation on the border, where violations of the UN's so-called ""Blue Line"" are usually committed by Israel. 
	
	
 ""It is Israel that is responsible for all kinds of provocative activities,"" one official source remarked, referring in particular to air raids and other aggressive acts against Lebanon. 
	
	
 Lebanese authorities expect the United States to curb such Israeli infractions, the official source added, rather than adopt Israeli claims and seek security for the Jewish state. 
	
	
 According to a government official in contact with US politicians recently, hostility toward Hizbullah has grown tremendously in recent months within the US administration. 
	
	
 The official did not rule out the possibility of seeing such animosity reflect negatively on relations with Lebanon and Syria - and on the region in general - on the eve of the Arab summit scheduled for March in Beirut.

TOKYO, Feb 17 (AFP) - Some 300 people demonstrated in Tokyo Sunday against US bases in Japan and the US military campaign in Afghanistan ahead of President George W. Bush's arrival for an official visit. 
	
	
 Demonstrators carried banners which read, ""US must stop war. US bases out now from Okinawa."" The Japanese southern island hosts 25,000 of the 51,000 US troops stationed in Japan. 
	
	
 The peaceful protest was held at Ebisu park some four kilometers (2.5 miles) west of the US embassy, where the US president is to stay until Tuesday. No one was arrested, police said. 
	
	
 ""We firmly oppose Bush's war expansion policy,"" said Kenju Watanabe, an official of Japan-South Korea People Solidarity, a Tokyo-based citizens' group at the rally. 
	
	
 The government plans to deploy some 18,000 police to boost security during Bush's first visit to Japan as president. 
	
	
 ""We are also against Japan's cooperation with the United States over any military action,"" Watanabe said. 
	
	
 Two Japanese warships left for the Indian Ocean on Tuesday to replace vessels already there in support of US-led military operations in Afghanistan. 
	
	
 The Japanese parliament passed a law last October allowing its military to give medical and logistical support to US forces in any action against Taliban-ruled Afghanistan but only in ""non-combat zones."" 
	
	
 It was the first time since World War II that parliament had passed legislation allowing Japanese troops to support US military action outside Japan and surrounding areas. 
	
	
 Another rally was held near the US embassy by some 50 members of environmental non-governmental organizations against a US alternative to the Kyoto climate change treaty. 
	
	
 Protesters carried banners reading ""Ratify the Kyoto Protocol"" and ""Koizumi say 'No' to Bush: Stick to Kyoto Protocol."" 
	
	
 On Thursday, Bush unveiled an alternative to the treaty he spurned last year, but some environmentalists claim that the proposal only benefits corporate America.

TAIPEI, Feb 17 (AFP) - Taiwan is keeping a wary eye on US President George W. Bush's China visit despite assurances by Washington that Taipei's interests would not be traded away during the trip. 
	
	
 Washington had guaranteed Taipei that it would not dilute its backing for the island in return for better relations with Beijing, Taiwan's foreign ministry spokeswoman Chang Siao-yueh told AFP. 
	
	
 ""Through some proper channels, we have been told that there should not be surprises"" during Bush's visit to China, she said. 
	
	
 The top US official handling Taiwan affairs, Richard Bush -- no relation of the president -- also sought to ease Taipei's concerns during a visit to the island last month. 
	
	
 ""He made it clear that relations between Taipei and Washington are getting better,"" said Joseph Wu, deputy director of National Chengchi University's Institute of International Relations. 
	
	
 Richard Bush is chairman and managing director of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) -- a body authorised by Washington to handle exchanges since it switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979. 
	
	
 The US president embarked on a week-long tour of Asia late Saturday with stopovers in Japan, South Korea and China. 
	
	
 He will meet Chinese President Jiang Zemin on February 21 and 22. 
	
	
 Wu said he believed overall Taiwan interests were protected from knocks by the Bush administration because the island enjoyed ""strong support"" among decision-makers in the White House, the State Department and the Department of Defense. 
	
	
 Washington announced in April 2001 the most comprehensive arms package to Taipei since 1992, including four Kidd-class destroyers, eight diesel submarines and 12 P-3C submarine-hunting aircraft. 
	
	
 The sale infuriated Beijing which regards Taiwan an integral part of its territory awaiting reunification, by force if necessary. 
	
	
 Before leaving for Asia, Bush said he would discuss with Beijing trade issues arising from China's entry into the World Trade Organisation, the global war on terror and the fate of Taiwan. 
	
	
 The president has called for a peaceful resolution of the sovereignty dispute between Taipei and Beijing which split at the end of a civil war in 1949. 
	
	
 Taiwanese officials are nonetheless concerned. 
	
	
 In a speech through videoconference to hundreds of Taiwanese and Taiwanese American students from Harvard, Yale, Columbia and other US universities, Taiwan's Vice President Annette Lu on Saturday warned of Beijing's attempt to obstruct cross-strait ties. 
	
	
 ""As usual, Beijing will try its best to persuade President Bush into saying something disadvantageous to Taiwan,"" she said ahead of Bush's Asian trip. ""Such a mindset will impair the healthy interaction between Taiwan and the People's Republic of China."" 
	
	
 Taiwan's foreign ministry has set up an ad hoc group to monitor Bush's Asia trip around-the-clock and report to President Chen Shui-bian, Chang said, adding Taipei's de facto embassy in Washington had a similar task. 
	
	
 Compounding fears is speculation that Bush may sign a fresh communique with China in return for Beijing's support on issues such as anti-terrorism and prevention of nuclear proliferation. 
	
	
 The two countries have sealed three joint communiques since the end of the 1970s. 
	
	
 The first was issued during then-president Richard Nixon's landmark trip to China in 1972 while another one, signed during the Ronald Reagan era, agreed to gradually reduce arms sales to Taiwan. 
	
	
 Wu defended Taipei's cautious approach, warning that Beijing could try to use the situation to gain the upper hand. 
	
	
 ""Taiwan's interest would be harmed if the Chinese leaders took advantage of the occasion by making remarks unfavorable to Taipei and Washington failed to defend Taipei,"" Wu warned. 
	
	
 Taipei was angered when then-president Bill Clinton pledged the ""three nos"" during his China visit in 1998. 
	
	
 Clinton said he did not support independence for Taiwan, the policy of ""two Chinas"" or ""one China, one Taiwan"" and agreed that Taiwan should not be a member of any organisation to which statehood is a requirement.

 Washington announced in April 2001 the most comprehensive arms package to Taipei since 1992, including four Kidd-class destroyers, eight diesel submarines and 12 P-3C submarine-hunting aircraft. 
	
	
 The sale infuriated Beijing which regards Taiwan an integral part of its territory awaiting reunification, by force if necessary. 
	
	
 On the eve of his departure for Asia, Bush said he would discuss with Beijing trade issues arising from China's entry into the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the global war on terrorism and the fate of Taiwan. The president has called for a peaceful resolution of the lingering sovereignty dispute between Taipei and Beijing which split at the end of a civil war in 1949. 
	
	
 But Taiwanese officials are nonetheless concerned. 
	
	
 The foreign ministry has set up an ad hoc group which will monitor Bush's Asian trip around-the-clock and report back to President Chen Shui-bian, Chang said, adding that Taiwan's de facto embassy in Washington had been given a similar task. 
	
	
 Compounding fears is speculation that Bush may sign a fresh communique with China in return for Beijing's support on issues such as anti-terrorism and prevention of nuclear proliferation. 
	
	
 The two countries have sealed three joint communiques since the end of the 1970s. 
	
	
 The first was issued during then-president Richard Nixon's landmark trip to China in 1972 while another one, signed during the Ronald Reagan era, agreed to gradually reduce arms sales to Taiwan. 
	
	
 Wu defended the government's cautious approach warning that Beijing could try to use the situation to gain the upper hand. 
	
	
 ""Taiwan's interest would be harmed if the Chinese leaders took advantage of the occasion by making remarks unfavorable to Taipei and Washington failed to defend Taipei,"" Wu warned. 
	
	
 Taipei was angered when then-president Bill Clinton pledged the ""three nos"" during his China visit in 1998. 
	
	
 Clinton said he did not support independence for Taiwan, the policy of ""two Chinas"" or ""one China, one Taiwan"" and agreed that Taiwan should not be a member of any organisation to which statehood is a requirement.

TOKYO, Feb 18 (AFP) -- US President George W. Bush said Monday that all options were on the table to deal with Iraq, Iran and North Korea, even as Germany warned against any ""adventure"" in Iraq. 
	
	
 At the start of his Asian tour, Bush dismissed a chilly reception by US allies to his ""axis of evil"" rhetoric, telling reporters in Tokyo, ""I will keep all options on the table. 
	
	
 ""We want to resolve all issues peacefully, whether it be Iraq, Iran or North Korea,"" Bush said, speaking next to Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. 
	
	
 Bush has lumped those three countries together in what terms an ""axis of evil,"" in language that has riled US allies. 
	
	
 The president renewed his pledge to thwart terrorist groups who want to ""mate up"" with regimes hoping to acquire weapons of mass destruction and said ""nations will come with us"" if the US-led war on terrorism is extended. 
	
	
 ""People who love freedom understand that we cannot allow nations that aren't transparent, nations with a terrible history, nations that are so dictatorial they're willing to starve their people, we can't allow them to mate up with terrorist organizations,"" Bush said. 
	
	
 Asked about French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine's criticism of the ""axis"" concept as ""simplistic,"" Bush said: ""I understand what happens in the international arena; people say things. 
	
	
 ""But the leaders I've talked to understand, exactly, what needs to happen. 
	
	
 ""They understand that our commitment is not just in Afghanistan, that history has given us a unique opportunity to defend freedom,"" he added. 
	
	
 Bush, who arrived in Tokyo Sunday at the start of a week-long trip that will also take him to Seoul and Beijing, held talks with Koizumi on the war effort in Afghanistan. 
	
	
 But the leaders did not ""specifically"" talk about military action against any other country, a senior US administration official said. 
	
	
 Bush is due to travel to Seoul Tuesday and the following day will visit the heavily fortified no-man's land between South Korea and communist North Korea. 
	
	
 The United States maintains some 37,000 troops on the Korean peninsula, and Bush has called the de-militarised zone dividing South Korea from its hardline communist northern neighbour ""one of the most dangerous places on earth"". 
	
	
 But his tough stand on P'yongyang has provoked concern in Seoul, where President Kim Tae-chung, who is in the last year of his five-year term, has been trying to prise the hermit state out of isolation. 
	
	
 South Korean ministers fear Bush's tough talking may put back by years Kim's so-called Sunshine Policy of establishing a permanent peace. 
	
	
 Angry anti-US protests erupted in Seoul ahead of Bush's arrival with police storming the American Chamber of Commerce and detaining 32 students occupying the building. 
	
	
 During the three-hour occupation, protesters hurled leaflets proclaiming Bush to be a ""war freak"". 
	
	
 US diplomats say Bush will seek to support Kim's Nobel Prize winning policy by offering new talks with the North, while remaining firm about North Korea's missile sales and its feared chemical and biological weapons programmes. 
	
	
 North Korea remains unconvinced, calling Bush the head of ""an empire of evil."" Its state media said last week that Bush ""is the most bellicose and heinous"" US president, and added his visit was only intended to ""fan up war hysteria"". 
	
	
 Even though US officials have stressed that no firm military plans exist for expanding the war on terror launched after the September 11 attacks, they said late Sunday that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein should go. 
	
	
 ""We've made no secret of the fact that we think that the world will be much safer when the Iraqi people have a regime that they deserve instead of the regime that they have,"" National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice told CBS television. 
	
	
 Washington has long accused Baghdad, under UN sanctions since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, of developing weapons of mass destruction. 
	
	
 But Baghdad insisted Sunday it could not be a threat to the United States. 
	
	
 ""It is the United States that is threatening Iraq and not the contrary. They are the ones attacking Iraq, not the other way round,"" said Ath-Thawra, mouthpiece of the ruling Baath party in Baghdad. 
	
	
 ""Even if Iraq possessed such weapons, it could not threaten the United States. How could it threaten a country that possesses weapons of mass destruction that could destroy entire planets?"" 
	
	
 In Berlin, Germany's chief government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye told journalists, ""The federal government cannot imagine that the United States government has an interest in engaging in an adventure"" in Iraq. 
	
	
 Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder had pledged ""undivided support"" for the fight against terrorism a week after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, saying, ""Germany is ready for risks, including military ones, but not for adventures."" 
	
	
 He had also insisted on the right of the allies to be informed and consulted about US plans. 
	
	
 The German government spokesman said it would be ""useful"" if UN observers could enter Iraq again to check for weapons of mass destruction. 
	
	
 German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer last week sharply criticised Bush's ""axis of evil"" remarks, telling a newspaper that such a concept ""gets us nowhere."" 
	
	
 Iran, which has long had tense relations with its western neighbor, voiced opposition to a new US strike against Iraq. 
	
	
 ""We hope that the issue would be solved through peaceful means, with initiatives from the UN secretary general and a more active role by the UN,"" Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi told a news conference. 
	
	
 ""We also hope that Iraq gives a favourable response and allows UN weapon inspectors"" to return to the country, he added. 
	
	
 Kharazi said that some 150 foreigners arrested recently on Iran's border with Pakistan were not members of the al-Qaeda terror network, but admitted some could be sympathisers and would be sent back to their home countries. 
	
	
 Among those being held were 40 women, between 70 and 80 children and a number of men of European, North African and Middle East origin, including a handful of Afghans. 
	
	
 A diplomatic source said the affair could become ""embarrassing"" for European countries, ""because of the insistence of the Americans on judging for themselves"" those who supported al-Qaeda. 
	
	
 Washington alleges that Tehran has allowed al-Qa'ida fighters and members of the Taliban regime to enter Iran, which Iranian officials have hotly denied but said they would act if provided with evidence. 
	
	
 In another verbal attack Kharazi accused the United States of wanting to exercise ""world dictatorship"" since the ""horrible attacks"" of September 11. 
	
	
 ""America's rulers have proved that they cannot be trusted,"" he said. ""They are seeking unilaterally to become the masters of the world and want to sweep aside all competitors from other countries."" 
	
	
 Afghan interim Interior Minister Yunus Qanooni told AFP that two suspects in last week's murder of aviation and tourism minister Abdul Rahman had been arrested in Saudi Arabia and could be sent back to Afghanistan.

 Taipei, Feb. 18 (CNA) -- Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien said Monday he does not expect any surprise developments to come from U.S. President George W. Bush's visit to mainland China later this week. 
	
	
 ""The United States has more than once briefed us on the main purposes of Bush's Asia tour before his departure and repeatedly guaranteed that Taiwan's interests won't be sacrificed during Bush's trip,"" Chien told a news conference. 
	
	
 Bush arrived in Japan Sunday at the start of a three-nation Asia tour that will also take him to South Korea and mainland China. 
	
	
 Noting that this is Bush's first visit to the Asia-Pacific area following his attendance at the annual informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum last October, Chien said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is keeping close tabs on the current trip. 
	
	
 According to Chien, the government has set up a special task force to facilitate communications with the United States and analyze relevant developments. ""The task force is working around the clock to monitor Bush's visit to Japan, south Korea and mainland China,"" he added. 
	
	
 The minister further said that since the communication channels between Taiwan and the United States have been operating smoothly, MOFA can fully grasp any possible developments. ""We hope that people will keep calm. They need not be nervous,"" he said. 
	
	
 Chien said he appreciated statements made by Bush prior to his departure that Taiwan is a friend of the United States and that the Taiwan Strait issue should be resolved peacefully. 
	
	
 Chien said the Republic of China government hopes that the United States will continue to play the role of ""promoter, stabilizer and balancer"" in cross-strait relations. 
	
	
 In his view, Chien went on, the main purpose of Bush's current Asia visit is to promote world peace and security. ""Bush hopes to take advantage of his trip to forge a consensus with U.S. allies in the Asia-Pacific area on his administration's fight against terrorism and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
	
	
 He said Bush is expected to discuss bilateral security cooperation, Japan's economic reforms and financial aid to Afghanistan in his talks with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. 
	
	
 During his trip to Seoul, Chien said, Bush is expected to exchange views with South Korean leaders on arms procurement and policies toward North Korea. 
	
	
 ""As for the topics to be touched upon in Bush's talks with Beijing leaders, the agenda will include mainland China's agricultural market opening, religious freedom and human rights condition, missile shield and Taiwan Strait issues,"" Chien noted.

Issues to deal with Iraq, Iran, and North Korea -- which the US President branded as the ""axis of evil"" in his statement to fight against international terrorism -- and activation of the Japanese economy were the major topics of discussion at the Japan-US summit talks held on 18 February between Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and US President George W. Bush. Regarding the ""axis of evil,"" the prime minister explained his resolve to buckle down on the issue, while continuously cooperating with the United States. It seems likely that in addition to its diplomatic efforts, the Japanese Government will be forced to take concrete actions, including improvement of its legal system, in case the United States takes military actions. With regard to the economic recovery on the other hand, the President announced his full support for the prime minister's structural reform and measures to fight deflation. It turned out that the prime minister will shoulder the burden of firmly carrying out the reforms, and realizing early economic recovery as international pledges. 
	
	
 Diplomacy and Security 
	
	
 ""I believe the comments on the 'axis of evil' reflect the firm resolve of President Bush and the United States against terrorism. While cooperating with the United States, Japan will take the initiative in tackling the issue for eradication of terrorism."" 
	
	
 At a joint news conference held after the summit talks, the prime minister announced his understanding and approval of the President's statement designed to deal with the ""axis of evil."" He then clarified a posture wherein Japan would cooperate with the United States as much as possible. 
	
	
 President Bush took up the matter of the ""axis of evil"" and Japan's economic recovery as topics at the beginning of the summit talks. As this indicates, discussion on the ""axis of evil"" was the main purpose of the President's visit to Japan. The prime minister announced his cooperation with the United States because he fully understands that ""the United States needs Japan's cooperation,"" (said a senior Foreign Ministry official). 
	
	
 Saying that ""all options are on the table"" to deal with the ""axis of evil,"" the President also stated at the summit talks that he would ""seek a peaceful settlement."" He explained a view aimed at solving the issue through diplomatic and other means for the time being. Ever since the President announced the ""axis of evil"" statement in January, Iran, Iraq, North Korea have been trying hard, out of the fear of possible confrontation with the United States, to deny their involvement in terrorism or proliferation of mass destruction weapons. ""The US strategy is beginning to work,"" (said a Foreign Ministry source). 
	
	
 To tighten the noose around the ""axis of evil,"" the Japanese Government will seek understanding and cooperation from European countries that are critical of the President. At the same time, Japan also plans to ""work on Iran and North Korea through Japan's own diplomatic channels for settlement of the issue,"" (according to a government source). 
	
	
 Since President Bush envisions using all options, however, we cannot deny the possibility that the United States may take military actions. The biggest concern in that case would be Japan's military support system. 
	
	
 It seems that the government will enact the law for emergencies in an area surrounding Japan if the United States takes military actions against North Korea. But the reality is that ""there are many problems, including role sharing in joint actions with the US military, that we need to settle if we want to apply the law,"" (said a Defense Agency source). Also, there is a possibility of armed attacks on Japan. But improvement has not yet been made to the emergency legislation system. 
	
	
 In the case of military actions against Iran on the other hand, it also seems that ""judging from the lessons we learned from the Gulf War, Japan, which relies on the crude oil from the Middle East, cannot refuse offering cooperation,"" (said a Defense Agency source). There is a strong view among officials of the government and the ruling parties that application of the law for special measures to deal with terrorism would be difficult because this law is limited to dealing with the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States only. 
	
	
 Moreover, Iraq is expected to fight back if it is attacked. This will lead us to the issue of exercising the right of collective self-defense. Therefore, the Japanese Government will be forced to introduce diverse legislation for the purpose of giving cooperation for US military actions.

The US President is giving two kinds of speeches. The first is improvised and not devoid of slips of the tongue. The second is carefully written and studied from every aspect, and represents the official policy of the country. There is controversy about which type is more credible. Perhaps improvisation is a better indication of the inclinations and personal convictions of the President, because by improvising he is expressing what runs through his mind since the tongue is an extension of the heart. On the other hand, written speeches are more indicative of the policy drafted by the decision-making circles for a final decision by the President. 
	
	
 The State of the Union Address, given by the President in a joint meeting of the House of Representatives and Senate every year, is a pre-prepared speech. Every phrase in it was carefully studied, particularly the phrase that referred to Iran, Iraq, and North Korea as an axis of evil. 
	
	
 Axis is a term that was created by Mussolini signifying the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan. As for evil, it is a term used by former President Reagan to describe the Soviet Union, although its evil was self-destructive, causing the country to collapse from within. 
	
	
 The new axis of evil, which Bush has come up with, by combining the words of Mussolini and Reagan, was not a successful choice. If it was viable to describe terrorist organizations as evil, then it is not viable to do the same for countries. Besides, politicians refer to good and evil only for purposes of intimidation and exaggeration. 
	
	
 During World War II, the axis countries were very strong and bound by an alliance. The new axis, however, represents small developing countries that are not linked by any alliance or cooperation. In fact, Iraq and Iran were involved in the longest destructive war during the second half of the 20th century. 
	
	
 As for North Korea, it is a country living in isolation and is keeping its good and evil from everyone else. Its name was only mentioned in the axis of evil to remove suspicion around the United States' hostility to Islam. 
	
	
 As for Iran, the United States is eager to open a dialogue with it, especially since the reform school in Iran is progressing at the expense of the traditional, conservative school. It is very unlikely that the United States would be involved in a war with it. 
	
	
 This leaves Iraq, which the Washington circles want to antagonize and to go to war with. 
	
	
 If the United States wages a war against Iraq then this would not be out of necessity, like the war against terrorism. It would be a choice that confirms the extremist inclinations of some members of the US Administration.

During the just-completed Japan-US summit between Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and US President George W. Bush, the primary topics discussed covered the actions to be taken against Iraq, Iran, and North Korea designated by the President as the ""Axis of Evil,"" and a recovery of the Japanese economy from the standpoint of global economic stability, resulting in confirmation of Japan-US collaboration. Both topics covered complex issues wherein the future is clouded, but both leaders vowed to assume a bold challenge and exchanged firm handshakes. ""Our positions are important not only for our two nations, but for the world,"" were the words spoken by both leaders in positioning the Japan-US alliance, but they will be faced with difficulties in terms of global security and economic concern. 
	
	
 ""History gave the United States an opportunity to defend freedom. We have taken action and our allies have offered their cooperation. Your hypothesis is not irrelevant."" 
	
	
 The above statement was made during the joint Japan-US leaders' news conference held at the official Prime Minister's Residence following the Japan-US summit on the 18th by the president, emphatically, in response to a US reporter's question saying, ""Will you be able to secure the assistance of allies in response to the 'Axis of Evil'?"" 
	
	
 Prime Minister Koizumi aligned himself and established a distinct cooperative stance in response to the President who has displayed unrelenting resolve and confidence in ""fighting terrorism,"" in declaring: ""The expression, 'Axis of Evil,' reflects the resolute determination of the United States to deal with terrorism. Japan, too, shall assume the initiative in taking action by collaborating with the United States and global society."" 
	
	
 In advance of the summit, officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) had visualized statements in response to the ""Axis of Evil,"" providing for a balance between ""collaboration with the United States"" and ""peaceful solutions."" However, Prime Minister Koizumi's message clearly emphasized collaboration with the United States. In reaction to the better-than-expected response, accompanying presidential sources acknowledged: ""We obtained extremely strong support."" 
	
	
 At noon of the 15th, three days before the summit, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Asia and the Pacific Mohser Aminzadeh made an emergency visit to Japan and conferred with the then-Administrative Vice Minister Yoshiji Nogami. 
	
	
 Deputy Minister Aminzadeh repeatedly said, ""In view of current strong conservative factions assuming a rigid stance against the United States, we cannot speak openly of improving relations with the United States, but reformist President Seyed Mohammad Khatami does not desire a confrontation with the United States."" It was a request asking for Prime Minister Koizumi to serve as a bridge in relations with President Bush, who names Iran as a member of the ""Axis of Evil."" 
	
	
 However, Nogami grimly replied, ""If so, Iran should refrain from actions referred to as aid for terrorists. The United States possesses solid evidence. If conditions do not change, there is no way Japan can assume a defensive stand."" ""The statement concerning 'Axis of Evil' is already showing its diplomatic effect."" When MOFA officials noticed Iran sheepishly making an approach, MOFA officials were immensely impressed by the US strategy inherent in the statement about the ""Axis of Evil."" 
	
	
 Just as President Bush himself has called for ""peaceful resolution in connection with actions to be taken against the ""Axis of Evil,"" the United States is viewed as organizing a global encirclement to achieve a diplomatic victory. However, such a scenario can be assured success only if it is underpinned by President Bush's ""policy of not excluding a variety of options"" inclusive of military action. 
	
	
 During the summit, Prime Minister Koizumi maintained a clear-cut collaborative stance towards the United States and emphasized: ""I got the impression that the President was objective and circumspect,"" but suggested caution in resorting to military action. However, in the backdrop there is the reality that the Japanese Government does not possess a strategy envisioning military actions nor a legal system or organization to collaborate with the United States in the event of military action. 
	
	
 However, according to a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Diet member who is an expert in defense issues, Prime Minister Koizumi's statements concerning actions to be taken in response to the ""Axis of Evil"" can be viewed as definitely encompassing a ""promise to collaborate on the premise that overseas military actions would be possible."" The same source expresses the concern that if Prime Minister Koizumi should retreat from his position in the future, ""Not only will he disappoint the United States, but the US' world strategy could be hobbled and lead to questions concerning the significance of the Japan-US alliance."" 
	
	
 ""The possibility is strong that the United States will launch an attack on Iraq,"" suggests Takushoku University professor Satoshi Morimoto, who continues, ""In collaborating with the United States, Japan should embrace its own strategies. The simultaneous, multiple terrorist attacks of September of last year, have caused a change in US defense strategy to an 'anti-terrorist war,' while the objective of the Japan-US alliance is changing from regional defense to a global strategy. The Japanese and US governments should restructure the Japan-US alliance via a strategy dialogue, and establish new Japan-US role assignments."" 
	
	
 In addition, Morimoto lists as specific topics to be covered by the strategy dialogue: (1) China-Asia strategy inclusive of North Korea, (2) Middle East strategy including Iraq and Iran, and (3) Designation of military roles as well as collective self-defense rights. 
	
	
 Japan has expressed its willingness to collaborate in the US world strategy to ""fight terrorism."" The true value of the ""Japan-US alliance critical to the world"" now requires action rather than mere lip service.

WASHINGTON -- The ground must be shaking under the feet of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, even as his admirers in the United States, George W. Bush et al, are sabre-rattling about America's new-found ""axis of evil"". 
	
	
 The news from Israel is almost earth-shattering. Over 20,000 Israelis -- a record number -- rallied for peace in Tel Aviv last Saturday, the biggest demonstration by the reawakened peace camp since the current Intifada was unleashed in September 2000. 
	
	
 Organisers were the Israeli Peace Now movement and the Israeli Peace Coalition. But what was most interesting is that, for the first time, a Palestinian Arab, Dr Sari Nusseibeh, the top Palestinian National Authority official in Jerusalem and president of Al Quds University, addressed the Israeli pro-peace rally. 
	
	
 Speaking in halting Hebrew, the San Francisco Chronicle reported, Nusseibeh said: ""I am here to tell you that there is no one to speak to, except Abu Ammar (Yasser Arafat) ... we want a warm peace, not a cold peace, between our nations."" 
	
	
 Other participants in the rally were some of the roughly 250 Israeli army reservists who have refused to serve in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories, Green Line: Students for Borders, the Meretz Party, Labour Party doves, the Kibbutz Movement, Netivot Shalom, the Bereaved Family Forum, Rabbis for Human Rights, Ta'ayush, Yesh Gvul and Gush Shalom. 
	
	
 Equally significant was the news that the Israeli Council for Peace and Security, a group of 1,000 top-level reserve generals, colonels and Shin Bet (security intelligence) and Mossad (military intelligence) officials are reportedly planning a public campaign for a ""unilateral"" Israeli withdrawal from all Gaza and much of the West Bank. 
	
	
 The organisation, according to the Israeli paper Haaretz, is calling for ""evacuating Gaza, dismantling 50 settlements, the immediate establishment of a Palestinian state, and immediate peace talks with Palestinians, whether there is a ceasefire or not"". 
	
	
 As these developments were signalling what one prominent Reform rabbi described as ""the resurrection of the moribund peace movement,"" Israelis were struck, in the words of The Guardian of London, by ""a devastating wave"" of Palestinian attacks last weekend on ""the symbols of Israeli military occupation -- a Jewish settlement, an army base and a road block, (thereby) badly shaking (their) faith"" in Sharon, who had promised them peace and security when he came to office a year ago. 
	
	
 ""Ariel Sharon's strategy is collapsing,"" said the influential Ma'ariv newspaper. ""At this stage, as difficult as it may be to say so openly, the Palestinians are losing the battles to a superior force, but Israel is losing the war."" In Ma'ariv's weekend opinion polls, some 49 per cent of Israelis agreed, saying the ""national leadership has lost control of the security situation"". 
	
	
 Internationally, there has been commendable movement to find a new beginning, now that the Oslo peace process is certifiably dead and the American ideas limited to the so-called Tenet and Mitchell plans are stuck for 18 months on ground zero. Although the French have not been able to win approval from their fellow-members in the European Union for new Palestinian elections and the establishment of a Palestinian state, the Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Pique, whose country holds the EU presidency, acknowledged that ""we are still debating a number of ideas"". 
	
	
 Whether there is merit in all these activities and ideas -- some seem doubtful -- the event that must have rocked the halls of power in Israel and the United States were the bold views of Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah were heard. 
	
	
 What the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia had in mind, he told the New York Times on Sunday, was to offer Israel, in an address at next month's Arab League summit in Beirut, ""full withdrawal from all the occupied territories, in accord with UN resolutions, including Jerusalem, for full normalisation of relations"" with the Arab world. 
	
	
 Crown Prince Abdullah's purpose was ""to make clear to the Israeli people that the Arabs don't reject or despise them but the Arab people do reject what their leadership is now doing to the Palestinians, which is inhumane and oppressive"". 
	
	
 But he told the paper's columnist Thomas L. Friedman, who has been very critical of Arab governments for sitting on the fence during the 17-month Palestinian uprising, that he has now changed his mind about his prepared speech ""when Sharon took the violence, and the oppression, to an unprecedented level"". 
	
	
 This Arab position is actually not new. The key party to the conflict with Israel, the Palestinians, have long argued that they were ready to accept the occupied territories, which amount to only 22 per cent of historic Palestine, as their own independent state. But what makes this offer exceptionally generous is the readiness of a key Arab leader to take this stand at the highest Arab political forum and campaign for it. The Arab argument of yesteryears was that peace could be established between Israel and the ""front-line"" states -- Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinians -- but the remaining Arab states are not obligated to establish diplomatic relations with Israel. 
	
	
 This time around, the tide has changed and the Saudi leader's willingness to take this unprecedented step merits more than positive responses from Israel and the United States. It demands immediate action.

 Taipei, Feb. 21 (CNA) -- Relations between Taiwan and the United States have increasingly become ""harmonious and close"" since U. S. President George W. Bush took office and Bush's current mainland visit is unlikely to affect the two-way ties, a presidential aide said Thursday. 
	
	
 Secretary-General of the Presidential Office Chen Shih-meng said the U. S. has repeatedly assured Taiwan that Bush will stick to his commitments to help protect Taiwan and he will not do or say anything that could damage Taiwan's interests while visiting mainland China. 
	
	
 According to Chen, the main purpose of Bush's mainland trip is to thank Beijing for its cooperation in the U.S.-led anti-terrorist war following last year's Sept. 11 terror attacks on Washington and New York. 
	
	
 Meanwhile, Chang Shiao-yue, spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reiterated that the United States had briefed Taiwan on Bush's mainland visit before his departure and made it clear that the trip would not hurt Taiwan's interests. She added the ministry has set up a task force to monitor developments and deal with all contingencies.

BEIJING, Feb 21 (AFP) - US President George W. Bush and Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Thursday carefully played down their countries' often glaring differences over Taiwan during the US leader's visit to Beijing. 
	
	
 Both scrupulously avoided combative talk on the issue, which has been a consistent source of tension between the countries for decades. 
	
	
 Bush, who arrived in China Thursday morning, said the United States hoped for a ""peaceful settlement"" to tensions between China and Taiwan and stressed Washington's policy on the island had not altered. 
	
	
 ""The position of my government has not changed over the years,"" Bush reassured his hosts. 
	
	
 ""We believe in the peaceful settlement of this issue."" 
	
	
 Bush reiterated his support for the Taiwan Relations Act, under which the United States is committed to providing the island with the means to defend itself. 
	
	
 But he also had a thinly veiled message for leaders in Taipei, saying ""we will urge there be no provocation"". 
	
	
 Bush's comments appeared designed to reassure Beijing that Washington has not shifted from its long-standing policy of avoiding making any explicit commitment to come to Taiwan's defence should China invade. 
	
	
 The tone contrasted sharply with the mood last year when Bush signed off on the biggest US arms sales to Taiwan in a decade. The sales angered Beijing and fuelled concern that Washington's tougher stance might encourage Taiwan to declare formal independence. 
	
	
 Bush's comments also pleased Taiwan's government, which pronounced itself satisfied and thanked Bush for his backing. 
	
	
 ""The press conference showed the result of the discussions entirely match our forecast,"" said Taiwanese Foreign Minister Eugene Chien. 
	
	
 He voiced his gratitude to Bush for ""having honored his commitment"" made to Taipei before the Asian trip, which also took Bush to Japan and South Korea. 
	
	
 Taiwan's foreign ministry spokeswoman had said ahead of Bush's departure for Asia that Washington had assured Taipei its interests would not be harmed. 
	
	
 However some officials voiced concern that China could secure concessions on Taiwan in return for supporting Bush on issues such as anti-terrorism and prevention of nuclear arms proliferation. 
	
	
 In his comments at the press conference, Jiang also avoided areas of contention over Taiwan, which split from the mainland in 1949 after the communist victory in China's civil war. 
	
	
 ""To properly handle the Taiwan question is vital to the stability and growth of China-US relations,"" Jiang said. 
	
	
 ""In my meeting with President Bush, I have elaborated on the Chinese government's basic position of peaceful reunification and 'one country two systems' for the solution of the Taiwan question."" 
	
	
 ""One country two systems"" is Beijing's proposal to reunify with Taiwan while allowing the island some autonomy in a similar arrangement to that which saw Hong Kong return to Chinese rule in 1997. 
	
	
 Taiwan on Thursday also called on China to reopen rapprochement talks. 
	
	
 Premier Yu Shyi-kun asked Chinese leaders to set aside differences with the island and engage in talks in the aftermath of both their entries to the World Trade Organisation (WTO). 
	
	
 Beijing has said it will not reopen talks with Taipei unless the Taiwanese government embraces its definition of ""one China"", under which Taiwan is considered part of its territory. 
	
	
 This is rejected by Taiwan's pro-independence President Chen Shui-bian. Dialogue across the Taiwan Straits has been frozen since he took office in May 1999.

TAIPEI, Feb 21 (AFP) - Taiwan Foreign Minister Eugene Chien on Thursday hailed US President George W. Bush for not trading away the island's interests to Beijing. 
	
	
 Chien said the closed-door meeting between Bush and his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin suggested there remained differences to be tackled. 
	
	
 As to the Taiwan issue, Chien said: ""The press conference showed the result of the discussions entirely match our forecast..."" 
	
	
 Chien voiced his gratitude to Bush for ""having honored his commitment"" he pledged to Taipei before his Asian trip, which also took him to Japan and South Korea. 
	
	
 Taiwan's foreign ministry spokeswoman had said ahead of Bush's departure for Asia that Washington had assured Taipei its interests would not be harmed. 
	
	
 Taiwan's foreign ministry has set up an ad hoc group to monitor the trip around-the-clock and report to President Chen Shui-bian. Taipei's de facto embassy in Washington has been given a similar task. 
	
	
 Chien said he also hoped ""Washington will continue to enhance its ties with Taipei while seeking to mend fences with Beijing."" 
	
	
 Bush, who arrived in China Thursday morning, said the United States hoped for a ""peaceful settlement"" to tensions between China and Taiwan and stressed Washington's policy on the island had not altered. 
	
	
 ""The position of my government has not changed over the years,"" Bush said. 
	
	
 ""We believe in the peaceful settlement of this issue."" 
	
	
 Bush reiterated his support for the Taiwan Relations Act, under which the United States is committed to providing the island with the means to defend itself. 
	
	
 Beijing has repeatedly threatened to take Taiwan by force should the island declare formal independence. 
	
	
 In a speech to the Japanese Diet (parliament) on Tuesday, Bush said the US would continue to support its allies in the Asia Pacific region. 
	
	
 ""We will continue to show American power and purpose in support of the Philippines ... Australia ... and Thailand ... America will remember our commitments to the people on Taiwan,"" he said, without elaborating.

Kiev, 22 February: Two US nationals were detained at Boryspil [Kiev international] airport while trying to carry 1 kg of heroin out of Ukraine. UNIAN learnt at the public relations department of the Ukrainian State Customs Service that Boryspil customs and Security Service of Ukraine officials discovered four transparent polyethylene bags with white powder during a customs inspection of two US nationals. The bags were not declared during verbal questioning in the ""green channel"". The bags were discovered during a personal search in the inspection room and were hidden in the shoe soles. A quick study of the substance, performed by the police, revealed that the powder was heroin. Its total weight was about 1 kg. The [US] nationals were booked on an Uzbek Airlines flight from Ukraine to the USA.

Hong Kong, 23 Feb (ZTS) -- US President Bush concluded a two-day working visit to China, during which he exchanged in-depth views on Sino-US relations and on major international and regional issues with the Chinese leaders, and reached extensive and important consensus. Both the Chinese and US sides hold that the visit has achieved positive and successful results. Hong Kong media also generally maintained a positive stance toward the trip and welcomed the visit. 
	
	
 Bush's visit to China has been a success. When he revisited the Great Wall, he could hardly hide his excitement. He wanted Chinese officials to show the places where Nixon had stood when he made the ice-breaking visit to the Great Wall 30 years ago. In front of the TV camera, Bush stepped several steps forward from the spot where Nixon had stood. This is to show the world that Sino-US relationship continues to move ahead from the existing basis. In an editorial, Wen Wei Po noted that 30 years ago Nixon developed strategic relations with China due to the US strategic interests and to the need to deal with the Soviet Union, the United States' biggest enemy. Thirty years later, the United States now considers itself the world's sole superpower. But the 11 September event makes Bush aware that the major enemy of the United States is terrorist groups, that US security is threatened, and that without support from other big countries, it will be difficult for the United States to win the war against terrorism. Bush then rediscovered the importance of China -- a big country on the other side of the globe -- and tries to develop ""constructive cooperative relations"" with China since it is in accord with US strategic interests. The United States appreciates the role that China plays in helping solve the conflict between India and Pakistan. Bush hopes that Jiang Zemin would mediate with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the US' behalf so that the United States can resume talks with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. There is a saying that ""people in the world work so hard to pursue gains."" That Bush chooses to increase contacts with China shows that it is impossible for the United States to deal with global issues alone, nor can it afford to ignore China's major role in international affairs. 
	
	
 We see that Bush stopped referring to the ""strategic competitor"" remark during his visit in China, since a confrontation between the two biggest countries on both sides of the Pacific brings no good to world peace and economic development. Hong Kong's public opinion hold that Bush's visit to China is like delivering a message to the ""China threat"" advocates in the US Republican Party: Now is the time to engage China in a positive manner. 
	
	
 In addition, during his stay in China, Bush expressed ""admiration"" and ""surprise"" on several occasions regarding the development and changes in China in recent years and on China's tremendous development potential. On 22 February, in a speech at Tsinghua University, Bush again stated that ""it is very hard for me to use words to describe the earth-shaking changes in China."" A Ta Kung Pao editorial pointed out that obviously Bush did not make these remarks out of courtesy to the hosts, but that development and changes in China did indeed leave a deep impression on Bush and his party. This will have a certain impact on the US Government's readjustment and implementation of policies toward China in the future. 
	
	
 Regarding the major contents and purpose of Bush's speech at Tsinghua University, it was, as overseas public opinion had expected, a promotion of US values to China. In an editorial, Hong Kong's Shang Pao pointed out that in the course of reform and opening up, the United States is a country that the Chinese people want to understand the most and that the United States is a country that is easiest to understand. Not only today, 10 years ago or even in the early days of China's reform and opening up, the broad mass of the Chinese people, young college students in particular, know about US values. The Chinese people not only understand American democracy, freedom, religions, and human rights, they also know quite well about American social, economic, and political problems, which is beyond Bush's imagination. That's why a student asked Bush yesterday how to handle social problems including the problem of the violation of human rights, which is getting worse day after day in the!
 United States. 
	
	
 The Taiwan issue was made prominent during Premier Zhu Rongji's meeting with Bush and in the questions posed to Bush by Tsinghua students. Hong Kong public opinion pointed out that this shows that the Chinese Government and people are extremely concerned about and dissatisfied with Bush's remarks on the Taiwan issue. The US Government should realize that the Taiwan issue is the most important and most sensitive core issue in Sino-US relations. The United States is greatly responsible for the slow settlement of the Taiwan issue and for the ""Taiwan independence"" forces running rampant. The US Government should earnestly abide by the three Sino-US joint communiques and relevant commitments, and properly handle the Taiwan issue from a strategic and long-term perspective. This is of vital importance to the situation in the Taiwan Strait, to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, as well as to the healthy development of Sino-US relations.

US President George W. Bush's East Asia tour came to an end with his final stopover at China. There were no remarkable agreements at the summit talks with Chinese President Jiang Zemin other than Jiang Zemin and Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao's promise to visit the United States. Yet, the biggest significance lies in that the United States and China reaffirmed cooperation for the world and Asia's peace and stability. 
	
	
 Bush's visit to China was set on the date of the 30th anniversary of ""former US President Richard Nixon's visit to China,"" which is said to be the ""week that changed the world."" This displayed intentions of both the United States and China to make Bush's China visit a ""new milestone"" for the two countries' relations based on the trust built by Nixon's visit (as US Ambassador to China Clark Randt cited). 
	
	
 Recently, both US and Chinese authorities often use the phrase, ""direct and constructive relationship of cooperation."" At the US-China summit talks, the gap between the two countries' points of confrontation such as on the issues of Taiwan and Iran, China's exportation of weapons of massive destruction, human rights, and religious suppression was not bridged. This means that regardless of such points of confrontation, the two countries will develop a relationship of cooperation. 
	
	
 At the first half of last year, the US-China relations drastically worsened. Bush redefined China as a ""strategic competitor"" and increased the sales level of arms to Taiwan. The row between the United States and China on the US missile defense program, China's suppression of the religious group Falungong, and the collision of the US and Chinese military aircraft was only becoming worse. 
	
	
 The two countries' relations began to improve since China expressed active support for international cooperation against terrorism in the wake of the simultaneous terrorist attacks on the United States last September. Bush made a commitment to a ""constructive relationship of cooperation"" at the US-China summit talks (in Shanghai) last October, and the US-China relations was restored. 
	
	
 As the exceptional comment on China that Bush made in his speech to the Japanese Diet during his visit shows, Bush's desire to develop ties with China is very strong. It is not that China is only making a dynamic economic progress and becoming a military superpower. It is preferable to gain China's understanding and cooperation on antiterrorism and strategic issues. 
	
	
 Of course, China will not concur with the United States' position, but it appears that the United States is trying to strengthen relations so that it can always convey a clear message to the Chinese side. 
	
	
 Bush's China visit this time also seemed as if the United States was returning to the engagement policy it took toward China during the Clinton administration era. Yet, the United States plans to take the policy of strengthening cooperation with China and involving China further in the international community. For the US-China cooperation to become a ""new milestone"" for peace and stability, it is necessary for China to become a nation with higher transparency.

US President George W. Bush is insisting on his somewhat insane plan to lump Iraq, Iran, and North Korea together. He sees an ""axis of evil"" here. 
	
	
 France's Finance Minister Laurent Fabius thinks that there is something the United States above all fails to understand: To secure the future, an increase in development aid is absolutely essential. Fabius says he sometimes has ""the feeling that they believe countries are poor because they want to be."" Spain's head of government and current EU Council President Jose Maria Aznar: ""This is a historic moment, since Europeans and North Americans must redefine their alliance."" 
	
	
 The Americans do not see this, quite the contrary. Secretary of State Colin Powell would have had to resign had he not given in. He had just recently -- and he was the highest-ranking military officer in the Gulf War in 1991 -- held that an attack against Iraq would be inappropriate, and now he is admonishing the Europeans that they should be criticizing not the United States but the dictatorial regime in Baghdad. 
	
	
 Previously, Powell saw clearly that the antiterrorist chain could break if Iraq were attacked without the approval of the Europeans. Today he says action could be taken without considering the Europeans. The British do not consider themselves to be European and are grateful to the Americans for their help in the Falklands War. Neither the United States nor Europe can count on them. 
	
	
 The ""axis of evil"" is ""not necessarily the expression that the Europeans would use,"" EU Commissioner for External and Security Policy Javier Solana says, but one should not dwell on the choice of words. 
	
	
 But it is precisely on this choice of words that we should dwell. Evil in politics has truly become an unmanageable concept. Manicheaism comes to us from late antiquity thanks to Manes, the religion's founder. It presupposes that light and darkness, good and evil, mind and matter are irreconcilably opposed forces. It is the Americans, however, who have not been able to live without a convincing concept of the enemy since the time of the Native Americans. 
	
	
 Weeks ago George W. Bush, who appears determined to install a new government in Baghdad, declared the creation of a Palestinian state as good as decided. Protests from Jerusalem. Bush backtracked. He would just as soon avoid a cultural war that had been talked about for so long. One must not force Iran to the side of Saddam Husayn. Jim Hoagland of the Washington Post understood that Bush is planning longer wars. It had been expected of the President that he would manage change in the world, Hoagland noted critically, and not try to change the world by command. 
	
	
 If it were only a matter of objective differences of opinion, than it would all be only half as wild. The differences could be resolved or a compromise could be reached. But the political classes in the United States, and not only they, consider America as something special, as ""God's own country."" The saying goes: ""I'm an American and I'm damned proud of it."" 
	
	
 It is the American mentality indeed that we will not be able to change until the end of mankind. So it has not done the US legal system any good that there is no enemy of consequence in sight. Who would have thought ten years ago that the United States would be capable of carrying fighters in an Afghan civil war across the sea and depriving them of their rights? They are vegetating in a place where they have no rights, because the intention is to deny them an appeal before court of law in the United States. It is true that Washington emphasizes repeatedly that the United States is in a war, but the right of all prisoners of war has long been denied these people who are so far only suspects. 
	
	
 Even German foreign policy, however late, has come to its senses. The most US-friendly member of the federal government, Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, reproached Washington for its ""narrow concept of security"" meaning that there is not enough money for maximum arms procurement and development aid simultaneously. Solidarity has its limits after all. ""Alliance partners,"" according to our Joschka, ""are not satellites.""

President Fernando Henrique Cardoso made a harsh appraisal of the situation in Argentina in a private conversation with a group of Swedish businessmen last Friday in Stockholm. He said that, in face of the economic and government paralysis, it is not possible to rule out the risk of a breakdown in the nation's institutions. ""There is concern over a degeneration of the democratic process in Argentina,"" the president stated, according to two of the meeting's participants. The Argentine question was raised by the president of the Swedish Trade Council, Ulf Dinkenspiel. He said he believed that the risk of contagion in the region has been overcome, but he asked President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who was in Argentina before traveling to Europe, for a more complete evaluation. The Brazilian president said that a solution for Argentina, even over a longer term, is not a sure thing, due to the institutional risk. 
	
	
 In his appraisal, the solution will demand many sacrifices by the elites and by the people, a true restructuring of the national compact. That restructuring has to go beyond the relations between the provinces and the central government, a traditional question in Argentina, the president said. However, that is likely just an aggravating factor in the crisis: the politicians who are running the Argentine process are almost exclusively from Buenos Aires or the province of Buenos Aires, like Governor Carlos Ruckauf. 
	
	
 According to Fernando Henrique, President Eduardo Duhalde has ""quite a sharp insight"" into the scope of the crisis. He also has a quality deemed necessary for exercising his office in the current crisis: political flexibility. After favorably describing Duhalde, the president asked for understanding and support for his Government. 
	
	
 Fernando Henrique was heard ""with interest and attention,"" as they say in diplomatic jargon, but he did not move the group. One of the businessmen present told Valor that the uncertainties in relation to Argentina involve not only the future, but mainly the country's present. ""We simply do not understand what is going on there,"" the businessman summarized.

The buffer zones that Ariel Sharon intends to establish are an explicit admission that Israelis can no longer live by the sword, that the occupation is not working, and Israeli reprisals are not meeting with success. Thinking of building a Great Wall of China in the Middle East, replete with elaborate fences and tunnels, is conceding that Israel is not safe, not a normal country. It cannot integrate itself into the region, it is an alien seedling and, thus, it is better to isolate and fortify itself as a lowly outpost. 
	
	
 A total disengagement from the Palestinians, complete with walls and razor wire, might provide Israel its long-desired security and might free it of the burden of trying to control seven million desperate Palestinians, any number of whom are willing to die in order to end the occupation. But separation will not mean an end to the occupation and no Israeli government can provide security as long as it persists in its efforts to maintain its presence beyond Israel's pre-1967 borders and to retain territories inhabited by millions of Palestinians. By now, it should be clear to everyone that retaliating against every act of Palestinian resistance with Israel's superior ability to punish Palestinians does not provide the security that Israelis are demanding. 
	
	
 The only way out of the current spiral of violence is for Israel to limit itself to areas within which it can assume responsibility for its citizens' security. This means a return to Israel's pre-1967 borders. 
	
	
 Practically speaking, a buffer zone will be near impossible to erect. A physical border between Israel and a new Palestinian state will be twisted and distorted to accommodate Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza. Unilateral separation without a negotiated agreement could be realized - only if Israel is willing to uproot around 100 settlements. Sharon says flatly he will not withdraw from a single settlement. He thinks that every settlement is important and is determined that Israelis must retain as much land in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as possible. 
	
	
 Then there is the eventual goal of the peace process: the coexistence of Israel with the state of Palestine. But Israel has not once deigned to propose that the Palestinians live with the Israelis as full citizens in the same sate. Israel does not want the Palestinians to be part of the same country, or have one of their own. 
	
	
 By a margin of 2-1, Israelis think Sharon has no plan to end the violence and the buffer idea buttresses this long-standing view. Sharon has not brought the Israeli public security. With grim determination, he has destroyed the peace process and the Oslo agreements. And now he doggedly continues to demolish and prevent any hope of a road to peaceful coexistence. Israelis do not wonder any longer how to get along with Palestinians but how to avoid the need for it. Sharon has ensured that Israelis are rapidly absorbing the lesson that no place in Israel can be considered safe. 
	
	
 A wall and miles of fences is not the best of solutions. Does anybody believe that the intifada can end as long as Israel persists in the occupation of the territories and Palestinians are willing to die in large numbers to deny Israel that privilege?

West aims 'to prop up MDC' 
	
	
 Herald Reporter - THE United States has imposed targeted sanctions on President Mugabe and other senior Government officials for the alleged deteriorating political situation in the country, the US embassy said at the weekend. 
	
	
 However, the Government has said the sanctions are meant to prop up the opposition MDC ahead of next month's presidential election. Foreign Affairs Secretary Mr Willard Chiwewe said the West was in a hurry to prop up the MDC. 
	
	
 The move follows the European Union's decision last Monday to impose sanctions on Cde Mugabe, Cabinet ministers, senior Government and military officials, including a freeze on their alleged overseas assets and a travel ban to the 15-nation bloc. 
	
	
 Dismissing the EU move last week, President Mugabe said Zimbabwe would withstand the sanctions imposed by Britain and its allies and would never abandon the land issue. 
	
	
 ""They are saying that they are placing sanctions on leaders so that they don't come to Europe. What is Europe. 
	
	
 ""What will I be wanting in Europe? We can visit other countries in Asia and Africa,"" he said at a rally in Nkayi. 
	
	
 The EU decision was roundly condemned by African countries, which described the move as neo-colonial. Nigeria, Tanzania, South Africa and the Organisation of African Unity lambasted the EU. 
	
	
 In a show of solidarity with Zimbabwe, Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa said African countries should not let themselves be manipulated by the EU and other powerful nations. 
	
	
 ""This is neo-colonialism and economic colonialism. I'm saying this because some are beginning to forget that it was in Berlin where they had gone to decide on the Balkanisation of this continent into countries which they later came to colonise."" 
	
	
 Namibia said Zimbabwe had the right to invite observers for its elections. It said there was no justification in the EU's move and the body should not regard itself as more competent than others in election observation. 
	
	
 In a statement yesterday, the US embassy said the travel ban has been imposed on the President, senior Government officials, ""certain persons"" with business dealings with Zimbabwe Government officials and their families. 
	
	
 The US embassy said the sanctions also applied to those who ""formulate, implement, or benefit from policies that undermine or injure Zimbabwe's democratic institutions or impede the functioning of a multi-party democracy. 
	
	
 ""The United States believes that targeted travel restrictions against those who are responsible for Zimbabwe's crisis will advance positive change by signalling our support for the democratic forces in Zimbabwe and focusing international scrutiny on the appropriate actors,"" the US embassy said.

No one expected the Israeli Government to issue its latest decision restricting President Yasir Arafat's movements and confining him to the city of Ramallah. This is especially true after the Palestinian Authority [PA] carried out the difficult Israeli demands and arrested three individuals whom Israel accuses of assassinating Israeli Minister Rah'avam Ze'evi despite the ramifications that these arrests could have led to on the internal Palestinian arena. However, the awareness, the challenges of the current stage, and the sense of responsibility overcame all the temporary factional considerations. 
	
	
 It is to be noted that over the past five days, the Palestinian side demonstrated clear self-restraint and abidance to the cease-fire despite Israel's provocations and the bloodbaths that the Israeli army committed against the Palestinians during this period. So far, Israel's provocations have led to the slaughter of more than 50 Palestinian males and females and injured scores of others. Moreover, the attacks are continuing on the Israeli military checkpoints even against vehicles transporting pregnant women in labor and against unarmed citizens trying to cross these checkpoints that have been erected between the beleaguered Palestinian towns and villages that are surrounded to the point of strangulation. 
	
	
 It is clearly obvious to the international community that the Palestinians seek peace. It is the Palestinians that are calling for the implementation of the agreements, understandings, and recommendations pertaining to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. They believe that these constitute a preliminary step to the resumption of the peace process at the point at which it stopped. They believe that such a step would lead to a permanent settlement of this conflict on the basis of the resolutions of international legitimacy. The Palestinians believe that such a step would realize their national aspirations to full sovereignty despite the perils and implications that such efforts may have on their national unity that puts the higher Palestinian interests above every other consideration. However, it appears as if the international community is tolerating the Israeli campaign of suppression that contradicts the efforts to calm down the situation and the Palestinian hand that is stretched for peace and a settlement. The Palestinians are sending out a clear message of peace that is loud and clear. However, the repeated Israeli message is the resort to all means to impede the march for peace and to consecrate violence and counter violence. 
	
	
 This state of affairs provides suitable conditions to Israel to continue its occupation, colonialism, and building of settlements that have been imposed by military force on the Palestinian territories since 1967 to date. These Israeli aims are clear and do not need further clarification or explanation. Israel's impossible terms cannot be met by a nation that is determined to preserve its dignity and national unity. They are no more than frail excuses and pretexts to evade the peace process since this process does not agree with the ideology of expansion and the building of settlements. This ideology was explicitly embraced by the rightist blocs in the ruling Israeli coalition and is implicitly encouraged by Labor Party ministers in the current Israeli Government.

 Head of International Cooperation Department of Romania's Nuclearelectrica Teodor Chirica says that the VVER-1000 technology to be contributed by Russian experts is accepted in the world because is coated for protection and built on US and German supervision and automation systems. ""The Russians have just concluded contracts for the export of four similar reactors, two each to China and India,"" Chirica told daily Ziarul Financiar on Thursday [28 February]. 
	
	
 Romania has built the first reactor at the Cernavoda n-plant on Canadian technology, having opted for a CANDU type of reactor instead of Russia's VVER-4000. The second reactor, which is to be commissioned in 2005, is also built on CANDU technology and estimated to cost $700 million to complete. 
	
	
 According to Russian specialists, the VVER-1000 type of reactor would cost some $800 million to commission, while Western technology, equipment, and services would cost Romania more than $1 billion. 
	
	
 Given the stake at play, namely electricity exports, other countries have also voiced interest in contributing to the finalization of works on reactor III and IV at Cernavoda. One of these countries is Turkey, a net importer of energy. On a recent visit to Turkey, Romania's Prime Minister Adrian Nastase presented his Turkish counterpart Bulent Ecevit the advantages of investments in the plant at Cernavoda, which include a generation price of $12/MWh. 
	
	
 The price for the energy generated at Cernavoda is some $6 higher than the cheapest energy generated by the water power plants, yet some $20 lower than the energy generated by the thermal plants.

The war maniacs of the United States' Bush administration continue to spew out vicious remarks against us, despite the strong protest and denunciation of people around the world. 
	
	
 Following his vicious remarks that called our country an axis of evil in his State of the Union address, it has already been revealed that [US President Bush] talked nonsense that the targets of the US anti-terrorism war will include not only international terrorist organizations but also countries that develop weapons of mass destruction [WMD]. There is no question about the WMD-developing countries he pointed out, including our country as well as Iraq and Iran. 
	
	
 High-ranking officials of the US administration, including US Vice President Cheney, actively chimed in with his absurd remarks. Inspecting US Air Force bases some time ago, Cheney maintained that the United States would not accept WMD threats. High-ranking officials of the state and defense departments made preposterous remarks, saying that our country is the world's biggest exporter of WMD, ballistic missiles, and relevant technology. This is another diversionary tactic to divert the criticism of people around the world, which was provoked by the fact that Bush had made an announcement on an axis of evil and it had caused a great controversy to the world, to us. 
	
	
 As everyone knows, the United States is currently getting strong criticism, denunciation, and rejection from many countries of the world, and is being cornered by impartial public opinion and the people due to Bush's referring to Iraq, Iran, and our country as an axis of evil. Bush, in fact, should not have made such remarks in his State of the Union address. Because the remarks absolutely do not go with the reputation of the United States, which is carrying out all kinds of vicious conduct. 
	
	
 The United States is indeed the ring leader and empire of evil, which perpetrates spiteful conduct of all kinds worldwide. It is the United States that possesses the world's largest quantity of WMD and inflicted nuclear disaster on humankind. It is also the United States that has placed the international situation in such a complex state and is going haywire to dominate the world. 
	
	
 It cannot be anything but gangster-like logic for such a country to label other countries, which are dignified sovereign states and UN members, as an axis of evil. Hence, the whole world is currently decrying the United States to such an extent. 
	
	
 According to a report, a majority of the residents even within the United States are denouncing Bush's reckless remarks. As a matter of fact, the fellow who wrote Bush's address inevitably submitted his resignation. Foreign news reported that the US White House announced that David Frum, a White House official who wrote President Bush's address, had submitted his resignation. This, in fact, signifies that he inevitably had to leave the White House, driven out by the anti-Bush hot winds from around the world. The US imperialist war maniacs are clinging to a new conspiracy in order to escape such a predicament and divert the arrows aimed at them in other directions. What they have crafted out of this was our so-called sales of weapons of mass destruction [WMD] and ballistic missiles and concerned technology sales. In order to add credibility to the US imperialist war maniacs' conspiracy, they did not forget to label our country as the number one country in WMD and ballistic missiles sales and concerned technology sales that were already mentioned. How accustomed they are to trickery! However, no one will fall for their acts. 
	
	
 As we mentioned earlier, it is the United States which produces and possesses the greatest number of nuclear weapons and WMD and it is also the United States that threatens other countries the most with these [weapons]. Not satisfied with this, the United States is trying to develop new nuclear weapons by resuming underground nuclear tests in the future. It is simply a blatant act of the world's worst rogue state to do someone harm. 
	
	
 The conduct of the United States will only invite worse criticism and rejection from world people in the future. The US authorities should stop these acts and making remarks that smear their own faces. We will continue to [unmonitorable for 20 secs] to US unjust acts in the future. We will fight the US imperialist war maniacs, including Bush, who try to threaten national dignity to the end and settle scores with them. The United States can never dampen or bend our unwavering will.

AMMAN -- The unemployment rate among the country's 48,000 engineers has dropped by 1.5 per cent since last year, a senior official at the Jordan Engineers Association (JEA) said on Thursday. 
	
	
 The rate last year was around 8.5 per cent, but in the first two months of 2002 it dropped to 7 per cent, said JEA President Azzam Hneidi. The total of unemployed engineers currently stands at 3,360, he said. 
	
	
 The association last year provided 867 unemployed engineers with job opportunities in several public and private institutions, thereby contributing to the decline, according to Hneidi. 
	
	
 The association will continue contacting the government and private institutions to supply them with engineers, he added. 
	
	
 Both the JEA and the Ministry of Housing and Public Works last year trained 759 new engineering graduates over the course of one year to prepare them for job opportunities, he said. 
	
	
 One of the JEA's obligations stipulated in its bylaws is to provide training for its members. This training takes the form of a full-time internship lasting from six months to one year, during which graduates are placed in professional settings to gain firsthand experience in the workplace. 
	
	
 ""The aim is to give the engineers a real chance to practise what they studied in theory at university,"" said Hneidi. 
	
	
 Engineers specialised in the electricity field, for example, are hired to work in an electric company for eight hours per day. 
	
	
 ""The trainee is paid between JD120-150 per month, and the association defrays JD30-50 of that monthly salary,"" said the JEA official. 
	
	
 The association annually allocates JD100,000 for training graduates. This year it plans to increase the number of trainees to 1,000 graduates, which will require more funds. 
	
	
 ""The association is willing to cover it,"" Hneidi said. 
	
	
 As the engineering sector has more graduates than job openings, the association's representative offices in the Gulf states look to bring engineers from Jordan to work in the Gulf, said Hneidi. 
	
	
 Unemployment prevails mainly among chemical, mechanical and civil engineering graduates, he said, adding that engineers specialised in electrical, computer and architectural engineering have no problem finding jobs. 
	
	
 The number of students in Jordanian public and private universities' engineering departments is around 6,000, excluding those in agricultural engineering. Around 2,000 new engineers enter the job market on an annual basis. 
	
	
 Currently, many engineering students in universities prefer to specialise in the electrical or computer disciplines because the demand for them is higher.

COOLUM, Australia, March 3 (AFP) -- Hopes of a breakthrough in the Commonwealth's bitter deadlock over Zimbabwe rose Sunday as Canada sought to resolve the row after African nations accused Britain of neo-colonialism. 
	
	
 Political violence in the lead up to Zimbabwe's elections next weekend again overshadowed the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) during a second day of crunch talks here. 
	
	
 Britain and Australia have abandoned their push to suspend Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth before the March 9-10 elections in face of increasingly angry opposition led by Nigeria, South Africa and Tanzania. 
	
	
 But Britain still wants sanctions imposed if Commonwealth monitors find evidence of ballot rigging. 
	
	
 They believe the credibility of the Commonwealth will be severely damaged if there is no decisive action. 
	
	
 British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Sunday that if President Robert Mugabe won and it were clear he had won by fraud, then he had no doubt Zimbabwe would be suspended. 
	
	
 ""I mean, if there wasn't (suspension) in these circumstances, the Commonwealth would be badly damaged,"" he warned. 
	
	
 However, Zimbabwe's minister of state for information, Jonathan Mayo, accused Blair of leading a ""racist"" campaign against its former colony and lashed out at his attacks on Mugabe as ""thoroughly disgraceful and unacceptable"". 
	
	
 ""What we do in Zimbabwe as an independent sovereign state is in accordance with our constitution and our laws,"" Moyo told reporters. 
	
	
 He also claimed the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai was a British sponsored candidate. 
	
	
 Tanzania's President Benjamin Mkapa earlier told journalists in a stout and rare public defence of Mugabe, that even discussing the situation at the Coolum talks threatened the ""prerogative and sovereign right of the people of Zimbabwe to make an unfettered choice of their leader and government"". 
	
	
 ""How does it (the Commonwealth) handle Zimbabwe? Why should it handle Zimbabwe?"", Mkapa said, railing at what is being perceived as interference in another country's internal affairs. 
	
	
 But proposals involving a timetable for the imposition of post-election sanctions put forward by Canada's Prime Minister Jean Chretien to the leaders' retreat provided the first sign of a possible breakthrough. 
	
	
 ""Everybody has agreed that nothing will be done before the elections"", Chretien told reporters here Sunday, adding a communique would be issued Monday. 
	
	
 ""The Canadian position was that the elections will occur a week from now and that we have observers there. We have to wait until the elections are over before concluding."" 
	
	
 He said the formula proposed by Canada would include ""a mechanism for a quick decision"" once the results of the elections are known, but would not be drawn further. 
	
	
 It is believed that the proposal calls for a report from observers within two weeks of the elections, and a decision to be made in full on whether to impose sanctions within four weeks. 
	
	
 Mugabe has reportedly told Blair ""to keep your pink nose out of our affairs,"" the Sun-Herald reported here Sunday. 
	
	
 ""Go to hell,"" said Mugabe. ""Our people have decided and that is what matters to us. It's not their (Britain's) right or responsibility to decide on our elections."" 
	
	
 Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer told Australian television Sunday there was some sympathy for Mugabe's comments among African leaders, whose countries were once part of the British empire. 
	
	
 ""There is still that very strong sense that Britain and other countries (are) sometimes being neo-colonialist."" 
	
	
 The 54-nation Commonwealth is one of the few organisations to have observers on the ground in Zimbabwe in the run-up to elections in which the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) led by Tsvangirai is challenging Mugabe's 22-year rule. 
	
	
 The issue has threatened to fracture the organisation along rich/poor, black/white lines, despite calls from its head, Queen Elizabeth II, in her opening address Saturday to work to bridge cultural differences. 
	
	
 Several Asian nations have privately said they would also oppose sanctions. 
	
	
 Fijian Foreign Minister Kaliopate Tavola told journalists that as a nation which has suffered Commonwealth sanctions, Fiji believed they were the wrong way to go. 
	
	
 Fiji was only readmitted to the Commonwealth in January after being expelled following the 2000 coup.

COOLUM, Australia March 3 Sapa 
	
	
 MKAPA SAYS PUNITIVE ACTION AGAINST ZIM PREMATURE 
	
	
 Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa joined his African counterparts here on Sunday in rejecting calls from Britain, Australia and Canada for punitive action against Zimbabwe ahead of the presidential elections in that country on March 9 and 10. 
	
	
 Speaking ahead of the second executive session of the Commonwealth Heads of government in the Australian east coast resort on Coolum, he said any decision on sanctions or suspension would be premature ahead of the election: ""The scene is evolving in Zimbabwe. It is not evolving in Coolum. If we are to make an intelligent, rational decision, then we need to allow the scene to be played out there. The Commonwealth had observers in Zimbabwe, so why don't we listen to them"", he told reporters. 
	
	
 Mkapa said he has a real problem with the media which assumed that if President Robert Mugabe won the elections, it would not have been a free and fair poll. 
	
	
 ""That's ridiculous. Let's wait and see...Let the observers give their observation and then we will know if its free and fair."" 
	
	
 Mkapa reiterated that quiet diplomacy was the correct route to follow, a view shared by his other Southern African Development Community colleagues. 
	
	
 Mkapa also indirectly criticised British Prime Minister Tony Blair who is on record as saying that the elections were likely not to be free and fair. 
	
	
 ""I don't think it has reached a point that we will have alienation because of what is going on in Zimbabwe. I do not like the assumption, that unless Mugabe or Zanu-PF loses the election, it will not be free and fair."" 
	
	
 Commonwealth leaders on Saturday delayed talks on how to respond to the political crisis in Zimbabwe, opting to do so on Sunday in the privacy of their traditional retreat, away from advisers and officials. 
	
	
 Blair has warned that the 54-member Commonwealth's reputation could be damaged if it failed to take decisive action against Mugabe. 
	
	
 The BBC reported that Blair was hopeful that if Mugabe did win the election then Zimbabwe's suspension from the h would follow.

[""Opinion"": ""Independence of UNCHR impugned by biased reports""] 
	
	
 The United Nations human rights rapporteur, Maurice Copithorne, on Friday once again repeated his stereotyped allegations against the Islamic Republic by expressing concern over what he called human rights violations in Iran. Copithorne, who has served in the UN post since 1995, through his Iran reports to the UN Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR), whose 53 member states open an annual six-week session on March 18, has clearly shown that he is under the strong influence of Zionist circles and Washington's biased attitude towards the Islamic Republic. The UN rapporteur's new report on Iran, which he submitted to the commission on Friday, includes nothing new. In most cases he described the legal punishments like floggings and executions of murderers and major drug traffickers that are applied based on the Shria, or Islamic law as human rights violations. In other cases, he made unfounded charges by accusing Iran of discrimination against women and minorities. He made such charges despite the fact that women's political, social and cultural participation is not less than that of men. Women in Iran hold managerial, academic and parliamentary posts and even have positions in the government and the cabinet. And as far as minorities are concerned, they enjoy rights equal to those of the Muslim majority, as they have their own representatives in Parliament and practice their religion quite freely. In his report, the UN human rights rapporteur also interfered in Iran's internal affairs. For instance, he denounced as a human rights violation the banning and seizure of satellite dishes in Iran, while the measure has been taken in line with the law. He also tried to portray a false image of the Judiciary and its officials and went so far as to accuse the Judiciary officials of human rights violations! This spiteful attitude clearly shows that Copithorne is only a hireling tasked with tarnishing the image of the Islamic Republic and its senior officials. Interestingly, although Copithorne has not visited Iran since 1996, he continues to submit his Iran reports to the UN Commission on Human Rights without having any knowledge of the realities in the Islamic Republic. This means that his annual anti-Iran reports are only dictated to him by Zionist circles and arrogant powers like the United States that lost their illegitimate interests in Iran with the victory of the Islamic Revolution and downfall of their puppet Pahlavi regime. Publishing such biased reports will only create mistrust among nations regarding the objectives and independence of the UN Commission on Human Rights.

Today the Council of EU environment ministers adopted the Commission's proposal for a decision to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. The European Commission strongly welcomes this decision. By taking this decision, the EU has reaffirmed its commitment to pursuing multilateral solutions to issues of global concern. With its decision to ratify the protocol at EU level, the European Union stays true to its ambition to enable the Kyoto Protocol to come into force by the World Summit on Sustainable Development in August/September 2002. The decision also makes the Member States' greenhouse gas reduction commitments (the so-called ""Burden-Sharing Agreement"") agreed in June 1998 legally binding. The EU continues to call for the United States to participate in the global framework for addressing climate change. 
	
	
 The President of the European Commission Romano Prodi said: ""Today is an historical moment for European efforts to combat climate change. I am very pleased that the Council has now approved the Kyoto Protocol thus enabling the EU to proceed with its ratification. I am confident that Member States will take the necessary steps in order to allow for a simultaneous ratification together with the European Community before 1 June 2002. Once again, the EU is exercising leadership in addressing this global environmental problem, as we have done in Bonn and Marrakech last year. We can only tackle climate change effectively through a multi-lateral process. I urge our partners both in the developed and in the developing countries to also ratify the Kyoto Protocol soon. We want the Protocol to enter into force before the World Summit on Sustainable Development this summer."" 
	
	
 Environment Commissioner Margot Wallstrom stated: ""This is indeed a good day for the climate and for sustainable development. The scientific evidence on climate change is stronger than ever. All countries have to act, but the industrialised countries have to take the lead. To protect our climate we will have to reduce emissions. We all know that even the targets in the Kyoto Protocol are only a first step if we want to prevent the severe consequences that climate change could have."" 
	
	
 ""Action to fight climate change is vital to achieve sustainable development, Mrs. Wallstrom added. I am convinced that improving the environment through technological progress can actually enhance our competitiveness and economic growth. This is what sustainable development is about: Protecting our eco-system while ensuring economic prosperity."" 
	
	
 The Commissioner also stated that she was grateful for the strong support received from the European Parliament to secure timely EU ratification, and pleased with the confirmation by the candidate countries that they are on track to ratify. The Commissioner finally welcomed indications by Japan, New Zealand and Norway that they are preparing for ratification, and strongly called on others, notably Russia, to do the same. 
	
	
 ""The fact that at least 25-30 industrialised countries are likely to ratify the Protocol within this year is a clear signal that the Kyoto Protocol, with its legally binding targets and timetables, is the only effective international framework for combating global warming."" 
	
	
 Referring to President Bush's climate change plan for the US that he announced on 14 February the Commissioner noted: ""These proposals will not lead to a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States but allow a significant increase. The EU has legally bound itself today to actually reduce its emissions. We continue to urge the United States to return to the Kyoto process."" 
	
	
 The Commissioner concluded by stressing the need for further EU emission reduction measures: ""The European Commission has already proposed measures to reduce emissions at the lowest economic cost, including an EC-wide emissions trading scheme to begin in 2005. Further proposals are in the pipeline. However, all Member States have to take their responsibility to ensure that they meet their burden-sharing targets."" 
	
	
 Together with the Member States, the European Community's instrument of ratification will now be deposited with the United Nations by 1st June, so as to enable the entry into force of the Protocol by the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg this September.

 Seoul, March 5 (Yonhap) -- The U.S. State Department on Tuesday (KST) rated the human rights situation in North Korea ""poor"" in its annual human rights report, casting dark clouds on the already tense relationship between Pyongyang and Washington. Recently, North Korea strongly denounced comments made by U.S. President George W. Bush during his Seoul visit last month accusing the North Korean leadership of starving its people while developing weapons of mass destruction. In the department's human rights report, the United States did not use the term ""axis of evil,"" which first appeared during President Bush's State of the Union address in late January. However, the report comprehensively blamed the North Korean authorities for committing wrong-doings in terms of human rights. It also took issue with the lack of religious freedom in the communist country. The U.S. report stated North Korean residents have no power to peacefully replace their government and cited reports of executions of citizens in the North. The report particularly designated North Korea, along with Myanmar, China, Iran, Iraq and Sudan as countries of special concern in connection with religious oppression. Such an unfavorable report for North Korea is likely to produce a negative effect on Pyongyang-Washington relations for the time being. North Korea is expected to call the U.S. administration's report a ""groundless plot"" or an ""intervention of domestic affairs."" ""The U.S. report is feared to further encourage North Korea's resistance against the United States, which was triggered by Bush's recent Seoul visit,"" a government source said Tuesday. Meanwhile, some experts do not regard future Pyongyang-Washington relations with such pessimism, saying this year's U.S. human rights report on North Korea was not as severe as previous years. yct9423@yna.co.kr

 Washington, March 4 (Yonhap) -- The U.S. State Department published its annual human rights country report Monday, reconfirming poor human rights conditions in North Korea. The ""Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2001,"" submitted to Congress, said North Korea's human rights record remained poor, and it continued to commit numerous serious abuses. It also estimated that anywhere from several hundreds of thousands to two million people died from starvation and related diseases. Other human rights abuses in the North included extrajudicial executions and disappearances. ""Citizens are detained arbitrarily, and many are held as political prisoners and prison conditions are harsh. The constitutional provisions for an independent judiciary and fair trials are not implemented in practice,"" the report said. On the other hand, the report described South Korea as ""generally respecting the human rights of its citizens"" although problems remain in some areas. The report pointed out as ""remaining problems"" in South Korea, police's physical or verbal abuses of detainees at times and the National Security Law (NSL)'s infringement upon free expression and other civil liberties. Other problems cited in the report include domestic violence, rape, child abuse, legal and societal discrimination against women and ethnic minorities. In particular, trafficking in persons was a problem. South Korea was cited in the report as a ""major transit point for alien smugglers, including traffickers of primarily Asian women and children for the sex trade and domestic servitude."" The report, however, noted the government has taken various steps to improve its human rights record. It also noted President Kim Dae-jung stated repeatedly that promoting the rights of women was a priority goal. In connection with freedom of speech and press, the report said the Seoul government abandoned direct control over the news media, but it continues to exercise indirect influence, and government officials vigorously lobby reporters and editors. It cited controversial massive tax probes of media firms which critics accused of being an attempt to curb media criticism of the government while the government maintained the tax audit was a legitimate activity and long overdue. Meanwhile, the report called Afghanistan ""a triumph for human rights in 2001,"" saying that after the U.S.-led war on terrorism, Afghan citizens have been released from the brutal and oppressive rule of the Taliban and Afghan women, who suffered violence and repression, are now beginning to resume their roles in society. The report also noted improvement in human rights records in such countries as Bahrain, Peru, Qatar and Oman. cjs2001@yna.co.kr

The American Department of State, in its annual report on human rights, has accused a number of countries, including Iran, of human rights violations. This is taking place at a time when the government of [George W.] Bush has been identified as the top violator of human rights of the last Christian year because of the restrictions imposed on the American citizens under the excuse of fighting terrorism. So far the Bush administration has denied its citizens their legitimate rights, has set up military courts to try the people charged with terrorism without giving the accused the right of appeal or the basic right to appoint a lawyer. Moreover, the American administration has violated the rights of the minorities and in particular the Muslim minority who have migrated to America. The American administration is keeping the Taleban and Al-Qa'idah prisoners in metal cages named detention centres and it is refusing to identify them as prisoners of war. This is another example of human rights violations in America. Only after the extensive protest of the world [media] and the human rights organizations, the American administration was compelled to partially recognize this right. The most interesting point is that America has been expelled from membership of the international human rights organization, because of its repeated violation of human rights. How can, under such circumstances, America allow itself to express an opinion over the issue of human rights in other countries? It seems that America's unilateral policy does not identify any limits for itself. The American administration, during Bush's presidency in particular, has adopted unilateral policies over such international issues as the reduction of strategic arms, environmental concerns including the Kyoto protocol, proposal to set up an international criminal court and lately over the fight against terrorism. The State Department's current expression of view on human rights records of other countries is in fact the continuation of the same unilateral policy pursued by the American administration. That is, American administration assumes the right to interfere in all international issues and internal affairs of other countries, but itself does not care about the concern of the global community vis-a-vis the American policies which at times influence a large part of the world. It is a human virtue to express concern on human rights issues in the world, but the American authorities - after massacring thousands of innocent people in Afghanistan under the excuse of fighting terrorism which is still continuing - cannot expect the people of the world to take seriously the annual report issued by their Department of State on human rights. They cannot, therefore, blame the world for viewing such reports as a tool to advance America's foreign policy.

 Pointing to the presence of Interpol officers and the representatives, ambassadors and military attaches from different countries, including Russia, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia and Italy, Parvin said despite the fact that it was the first exhibition of its kind in Iran, it was extensively welcomed by many companies. 
	
	
 He also gave the news about the holding of a similar exhibition by Iran and Russia in Moscow and hoped that the Iranian companies would present their equipment at this exhibition. 
	
	
 At this ceremony, the Iranian Sa-Iran, Ava-e Nasr-e Novin and Mahan Industry companies as well as foreign companies from Russia, Britain, and the Netherlands received awards as the superior companies at the exhibition.

BEIJING, March 5 (AFP) -- Beijing condemned Tuesday as ""unreasonable"" an annual US State Department report that criticised China's human rights record for abuses including torture and the repression of religious and ethnic minorities. 
	
	
 ""The State Department 2001 human rights report goes against the facts and is interference in China's internal affairs under the pretext of human rights,"" foreign ministry spokesman Kong Quan said. 
	
	
 ""The Chinese government and people express their deep dissatisfaction and firm opposition,"" he told a press conference. 
	
	
 The 2001 Country Reports on Human Rights, released in Washington Monday, also gave poor grades on rights to North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Myanmar [Burma] and Vietnam as well as mixed reviews to Indonesia and Cambodia. 
	
	
 The Chinese government was devoted to promoting and safeguarding human rights and fundamental freedoms, Kong said, and added there were ""numerous cases"" of human rights violations in the United States. 
	
	
 ""The US government turns a blind eye to this situation and points fingers at the internal affairs of other countries and distorts the status of human rights in other countries. 
	
	
 ""This is unreasonable and done with ulterior motives,"" he said. 
	
	
 Kong also warned Washington against double standards in the global war against terrorism. 
	
	
 Uyghur separatists seeking to establish an independent ""East Turkestan"" in China's western-most Xinjiang region were terrorists who had cooperated with Afghanistan's former Taliban regime and needed to be wiped out, he said. 
	
	
 ""East Turkestan forces are participating in and fighting with the Taliban, this is a fact known to all, they are a component of international terrorist forces and a target of international forces fighting terrorism,"" he said. 
	
	
 The United States has rejected China's repeated calls to consider Xinjiang separatists as terrorists. 
	
	
 Beijing's human rights record throughout 2001 ""remained poor"", the State Department concluded in its scathing 70,000-word report. 
	
	
 ""Authorities still were quick to suppress any person or group, whether religious, political, or social, that they perceived to be a threat to government power or to national stability, and citizens who sought to express openly dissenting political and religious views continued to live in an environment filled with repression,"" the report charged.

AMMAN -- Jordan said it will sign the Kyoto Protocol, a UN pact on impeding global greenhouse gas emissions, following a recent Cabinet decision, according to Faris Juneidi, director general of the General Corporation for Environment Protection (GCEP). 
	
	
 ""Soon, the government will delegate Jordan's representative to the United Nations, HH Prince Zeid Ben Raad, to sign the protocol,"" Juneidi told The Jordan Times on Tuesday, adding that an exact date for signing of the environmental agreement had not been set. 
	
	
 In 1997, at a UN conference in Kyoto, Japan, the Kyoto Protocol legally obliged developed countries to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions by 8 per cent (below 1990 levels) between 2008 and 2012. 
	
	
 Although developed countries are the world's main source of large-scale air pollution, Jordan's decision to sign the protocol is aimed at stressing its ""commitment towards the different international conventions,"" Juneidi said. 
	
	
 With the signing of the protocol, he said, GCEP hopes to attract more funding to contribute to the international community's efforts in reducing greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the earth's atmosphere thus causing climate change. 
	
	
 GCEP, an agency operating under the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs and the Environment, is the country's point of reference for environmental pacts. 
	
	
 On Monday, the 15 European Union member states agreed to be formally bound to the Kyoto accord, and complete the ratification by June 1 this year. 
	
	
 In March 2001, the US administration opposed the protocol by saying that it contravenes US economic interests, a decision slammed by European Union countries at the time. Instead the US government produced its own alternative climate change strategy aimed at encouraging industries to trim their emissions. 
	
	
 Other developed countries like Canada have shown reluctance towards signing the Kyoto Protocol, saying it would cut the national GDP by up to 2.5 per cent in 2010 and cause economic damage worth 30 billion Canadian dollars ($19 billion).

BEIJING, March 6 (AFP) -- China's foreign minister on Wednesday pledged to expand ""constructive and cooperative"" relations with the United States, in a notably conciliatory performance at his annual get-together with the media. 
	
	
 ""We are ready to work together with the US side to narrow differences, expand common ground, increase exchanges and promote cooperation in order to further push forward the constructive and cooperative ties,"" Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan told journalists. 
	
	
 In a press conference on the sidelines of the current full session of parliament -- his annual opportunity to present China's foreign policy objectives to the outside world -- Tang largely steered clear of subjects over which Beijing and Washington disagree. 
	
	
 Even when the perennially divisive issue of Taiwan was raised by reporters, he offered only mild and routine criticism of US policy towards the island. 
	
	
 China had always ""firmly opposed"" the US Taiwan Affairs Act, which mandates by law the US defense of Taiwan and forms the basis for US arms sales to the island, he said. 
	
	
 Tang called on Washington to uphold the so-called ""one China policy"" -- the centrepiece of Beijing's dealings with Taiwan which categorises the island is an inalienable part of mainland territory -- but failed to specifically condemn Washington's arms sales to Taipei. 
	
	
 However he stressed that Taiwan remained the crucial issue between the two. 
	
	
 ""I wish to emphasize that the Taiwan question remains the most sensitive and most important issue at the core of the Sino-US relationship,"" he said. 
	
	
 Sino-US ties have greatly improved since Beijing backed the US fight against global terrorism and its bombing campaign of terrorist targets in Afghanistan following the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States. 
	
	
 The tone of Tang's press conference was markedly different to that of last year's equivalent event, during which he roundly criticised United States arms sales to Taiwan. 
	
	
 Sino-US relations took a more serious dip a month afterwards during a crisis over the collision between a US surveillance plane and a Chinese fighter jet over the South China Sea. 
	
	
 Tang conceded there had been ""twists and turns"" following US President George W. Bush's accession to the US presidency in early last year, but said the relationship had improved with Bush's visits to China in October and last month. 
	
	
 ""President Jiang and President Bush held an important meeting in Shanghai in October where they agreed that both countries would work together to build a constructive and cooperative relationship. 
	
	
 ""This is a very important consensus,"" Tang said. 
	
	
 When asked whether the anti-terror alliance meant good relations between the country were based purely on expediency, Tang disagreed, saying cooperation ""was long-term"". 
	
	
 China will seek to improve the relationship still further during visits by President Jiang Zemin and Vice President Hu Jintao to Washington later this year. 
	
	
 Tang further announced that Liu Jieyi, the director general of the Chinese Foreign Ministry section in charge of arms control, was in Washington for talks on weapons proliferation and issues concerning the global security. 
	
	
 US accusations of China's alleged proliferation of weapons of mass destruction have long been countered by Beijing with loud opposition to US weapon sales to Taiwan. 
	
	
 Overall, despite a ""grim and complicated"" post September 11 international order, China still maintained that ""peace, stability and development"" remained the main themes characterizing the world environment, Tang said.

Spain believes Camp X-Ray prisoners treated humanely 
	
	
 Text of report by Spanish news agency Efe 
	
	
 Madrid, 10 March: The government, the current holder of the rotating EU presidency, thinks that it is not appropriate to make further representations to the USA about the situation of the Taliban prisoners held at the Guantanamo base since it holds that the treatment they are receiving is ""humane and reasonable"". This is what the government says in several parliamentary answers requested by IU [United Left], BNG [Galician Nationalist Bloc] and IC-V [Initiative for Catalonia-Greens] to which Efe has had access and which say that ""to describe the treatment applied to the prisoners as inhumane is not justified, nor do the so widely circulated and commented on photographs of the prisoners at Guantanamo reflect the humane and reasonable treatment they are being given"". The government is ""convinced"" that the Bush administration will guarantee the fundamental rights of any prisoner and makes clear that ""it has no reason to think otherwise"", since the USA has expressed its readiness to guarantee these rights and has given the ""appropriate assurances that the treatment given to the prisoners is the appropriate one"". In its reply it recalls that from the outset the EU passed on ""confidentially"" its ""worries"" about the treatment the prisoners were receiving but it explains that both the British government and the International Committee of the Red Cross have recognized that the treatment is in line with international humanitarian norms.

Yesterday [4 March] the US Department of State publicized its yearly report in which it analyzes the ""human rights situation in the world."" The authors' particular concern is raised by the situation in China, Russia, and Saudi Arabia. In these countries in 2001, ""human rights were violated particularly frequently and unceremoniously."" Israel was also the target of no small number of critical shots. 
	
	
 China is charged with, ""under the pretext of the international antiterrorist campaign,"" beginning ""a new offensive on religious minorities, persecuting Muslims in its Xinjang-Uighur autonomous region."" Russia is accused of the ""excessive use of force"" against Chechen separatists, of ""injudicial"" shootings and arrests in Chechnya. Saudi Arabia is accused of torture, to which prisoners in this country are subject to. 
	
	
 However, the State Department gives the Saudi government its due, recalling Crown Prince Abdallah's peacemaking initiative, proposing that the Arab world recognize Tel-Aviv in exchange for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from occupied Palestinian lands. Possibly, in the eyes of the report's authors, such a step on the part of Riyadh excuses it to a certain extent for its other transgressions. 
	
	
 Something similar is said regarding Israel's fight against the Hamas and Hezbollah terrorist groups. Figures are cited: last year 200 individuals died at the hands of terrorists, and more than 1,500 were injured. Officially Israel recognizes the Palestinians' rights to their lands in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank of the Jordan River, but it is conducting a war without rules, ""utilizing force in an inappropriate volume."" Although, of course, these super-rigid activities are to a great extent warranted, the State Department notes. Incidentally, the State Department does not consider Russia's involvement in the antiterrorist campaign a ""mitigating factor.""

JAKARTA (Agency): Indonesia and Singapore have agreed to settle their differences quietly following a row over claims by Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew that terrorist leaders are at large in Indonesia, Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda said as quoted by AFP Tuesday. 
	
	
 ""The two governments have actually reached an agreement not to settle their dispute openly, but to settle whatever had arisen from the statement by Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew through official channels,"" Hassan told reporters. 
	
	
 The neighboring countries have several mechanisms for handling disputes, he said, without elaborating. 
	
	
 Lee last month said leaders of regional extremist cells are still at large in Indonesia. A Singapore government statement identified Indonesian Muslim cleric Abu Bakar Ba'asyir as one ofthem. 
	
	
 The claim sparked protests and demonstrations in Jakarta and Hassan called it ""provocative"". 
	
	
 Singapore late last year 13 suspected members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist group for allegedly plotting to blow up US targets there. It says some of them have named Ba'asyir, who runs a Muslim boarding school in Central Java, as a leader. 
	
	
 Ba'asyir last week filed a 100 million dollar libel lawsuit against the Singapore government. 
	
	
 The cleric, who has been questioned by Indonesian police but not detained, denies any links to international terror. But he has described Osama bin Laden, the alleged mastermind of the September 11 attacks on the US, as ""a true Muslim fighter"". 
	
	
 Indonesia has come under pressure from several quarters to take tougher action against alleged terrorist leaders but has played down the threat.

AMMAN -- The government is preparing official replies to two recent international reports on human rights practices in Jordan. 
	
	
 The replies to an Amnesty International report issued on Feb. 5 and a US State Department country report on human rights practices in Jordan issued on March 4 will be ready next month, said Ambassador Abdul Latif Bawab. ""We have contacted all concerned authorities, starting with the Interior Ministry and law enforcement agencies, to gather comments and suggestions to be included in our replies,"" said Bawab, who is responsible for the international organisations desk at the Foreign Ministry. 
	
	
 In a report entitled ""Jordan: New Security Measures Violate Human Rights,"" Amnesty International expressed concern about laws and amendments introduced to the Penal Code after the Sept. 11 terror attacks in the US as part of an anti-terrorism package. 
	
	
 The temporary laws ""expand the scope and definition of terrorism and place additional restrictions on freedom of expression and the press,"" the Amnesty report said. 
	
	
 The 12-page State Department annual report on human rights in the Kingdom said there were cases of arbitrary arrests and incommunicado detentions in 2001. 
	
	
 Bawab declined to comment on the merits of the reports, saying the government will make its replies to the reports public when they are ready. 
	
	
 Ambassador Bawab only said the State Department's report was ""repetitive,"" pointing out that in some cases it contained three or four separate references to the same incidents, some of which were already mentioned in previous years' reports. 
	
	
 ""Our reply is going to be brief, because we feel that the report is repetitive,"" Bawab said. 
	
	
 According to US official sources, only 10 per cent of the countries on which the State Department publishes human rights annual reports issues official replies. 
	
	
 ""We do not have to reply, but we have been replying for years, because we believe in our good [human rights] record and feel that we have nothing to hide,"" Bawab said. 
	
	
 On Sept. 25, amendments to the Penal Code stipulated sentences of up to three years in jail and a JD5,000 fine for the publication of reports ""sowing the seeds of hatred and malice,"" or disparaging the Royal Family and heads of state of friendly countries. 
	
	
 Another amendment defined terrorism as ""any act of violence or use of threat, regardless of reason and aim, executed individually or collectively to disturb public order and endanger public safety and security."" 
	
	
 According to Amnesty, these amendments ""criminalise peaceful activities unrelated to politically motivated violence."" 
	
	
 The State Department report alleged that ""the government restricts freedom of assembly"" and ""there are significant restrictions on citizens' rights to change their government."" 
	
	
 It also cited ""a lack of transparent investigations into allegations of wrongful deaths that occurred during police detention in previous years."" 
	
	
 Jordan is a signatory to most rights conventions, from the 1948 Universal Declaration on Human Rights to the Civil Covenant on Human Rights and the more recent Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women. 
	
	
 The government is currently taking legislative steps for the establishment of a National Centre for Human Rights (NCHR), following recommendations by a Royal Commission on Human Rights established by His Majesty King Abdullah in March 2000 and chaired by Her Majesty Queen Rania. 
	
	
 The country's eight independent human rights organisations have welcomed steps to set up the NCHR, which, according to the draft law for its creation, will act as an ""ombudsman"" office to look into individual claims of human rights violations and abuses. 
	
	
 Neither Amnesty International's nor the US State Department's report mention the steps taken for the establishment of an ombudsman office, which would be the first of its kind in the region. 
	
	
 According to human rights activist Saeda Kilani, reports by the State Department and other international watchdogs are no longer received with ""shock"" by public opinion and officialdom alike, thanks to increased public awareness and access to information. 
	
	
 ""A few years ago, these reports were shocking: It was only from such documents that many heard for the first time about issues such as domestic abuse or honour crimes in Jordan,"" said Kilani, who is also the Jordan representative of Transparency International. 
	
	
 ""But now more people know about these issues, public awareness and access to information have increased, and special centres for women and children are being established,"" she continued. 
	
	
 As awareness increases and public institutions start addressing issues that were taboos only a few years ago, additional pressure is on the authors of human rights reports to be more accurate, Kilani noted. 
	
	
 ""Now more people will be able to judge if a report is not so well sourced, or thoroughly investigated,"" she said.

The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught: 
	
	
 ""It is the current of history that the desire of the people is realized and the cause of justice wins."" 
	
	
 Justice always finds support and sympathy. In contrast, injustice cannot escape denunciation and rejection. An overview of international developments in February, among other things, clearly points to this fact. 
	
	
 As was reported, US President Bush, unreasonably linking the ""weapons of mass destruction [WMD]"" and ""support of terror"" issues to us and Iran and Iraq, raved about what he called ""axis of evil."" By doing so, he openly declared policy of isolation and stifling against the progressive nations. Subsequently, Bush repeatedly trumpeted his ""axis of evil"" theory on many occasions and, when he sneaked into Japan and South Korea, too, made nonsensical gaffes getting on the nerves of our country and other countries. US military and diplomatic officials also came forward justifying Bush's ""axis of evil"" remark. 
	
	
 Bush's ""axis of evil"" argument is an undisguised declaration of war and a rhetoric threatening aggression. 
	
	
 The United States produces and holds the largest number of WMD in the world. It is also the biggest terrorist country. It precisely is an empire of evil. Notwithstanding, the United States is insisting that so-and-so is part of the ""axis of evil."" 
	
	
 It is impossible to expect members of international communities to accept such US policy. None of them approves of Bush's one-sided, self-righteous policy. Everyone opposes and rejects it. 
	
	
 In February, the media in many countries around the world and international public opinion came forward opposing Bush's ""axis of evil"" remark. Voices criticizing it rose high among big powers, too. 
	
	
 China and Russia took exception to the gaffe, stating that they ""oppose"" it or ""find no grounds for any support."" This sort of position and posture on the part of big powers drove the United States into a corner. 
	
	
 Washington is even more troubled by the attitude of Western nations and allies toward the United States. 
	
	
 In February, the European Union [EU] stepped up its moves to bluntly criticize and oppose the ""axis of evil"" rhetoric. A spokesman of the EU Commission, at a press conference, expressed concerns over the Bush gaffe labeling [North] Korea, Iran, and Iraq as the ""axis of evil"" and said that ""the EU's high representatives do not agree to such policy."" The French foreign minister demanded that the United States abandon its one-sidedness, saying that global problems cannot be solved by Washington's arbitrary decision. The UK foreign minister said that, although the UK has been acting as a close ally of the United States since the ""11 September incident,"" it ""can no longer stand shoulder to shoulder"" with it. One can imagine the extent of such EU sentiment from the descriptions of Bush in French newspapers, such as one depicting him as the modern, 21st-century version of ""The Stars and Stripes."" Also, there was a cartoon showing him in so ferocious an image wearing a T-shirt and jogging pants bearing some English letters, baring his teeth and with a glare of hatred in his eyes. Representatives of more than 40 political parties of 25 European countries even sent letters of protest to Bush. 
	
	
 Western nations and US allies, for the first time ever, took such a concerted stance critical of Washington. In the past, it was their attitude trying to read Washington's mind and doing nothing that would incur its displeasure. This time, however, they spoke out against it and attacked without hesitation. Inside the United States itself, too, there were widespread debates against the Bush gaffe. 
	
	
 The United States found itself under fire at international conference halls, too. A typical example: An international conference of representatives of nongovernmental organizations from more than 150 countries, held in Brazil, adopted a resolution criticizing Bush's ""axis of evil"" argument. Meanwhile, in various countries around the world, demonstrations and rallies against the Bush remark and the United States were held almost daily. Countless letters, statements, and comments protesting the gaffe were made public. Bush, in a flurry at such moves, went the length of staging the farce of creating a permanent diplomatic agency to prevent the spread of anti-US sentiment. The United States found itself literally in the plight of a punching bag. 
	
	
 In February, Japan, along with the United States, became another target of strong denunciation. It was because Japan, taking the stand supporting Bush's ""axis of evil"" rhetoric, openly embarked on the path of maneuvering for overseas aggression. Like this, it is inevitable for injustice to meet denunciation and rejection. 
	
	
 Justice always finds support, however. In February, many countries around the world and international public opinion came forth supporting our country. Newspapers, news agencies, and broadcasts in many countries -- including China, Russia, Cuba, Syria, Vietnam, Laos, France, Nepal, United Kingdom, Libya, and United Arab Emirates -- gave prominent coverage to the statement of the foreign ministry spokesman of our country. This fact proved that the world stands on the side of justice. Rallies for solidarity with our country were held in many countries around the world. In a rally held in Syria, activists emphasized that ""we will continue to strengthen our solidarity with the Korean people and always stand with them in the same trench steadfastly."" In a forum of European political parties, held in Belgium, participants appealed to all progressive political parties of the world to defend Korea's socialism. At a P'yongyang joint conference, too, of organizations of friendship and solidarity with the Korean people and international organizations for democracy, participants adopted a resolution and sent a letter of protest Bush. All this clearly shows the extent of world support for the cause of justice of our people. 
	
	
 The position of Middle East nations for a fair settlement on problems of their region also won the support of international communities. To prove it, the arguments gained ground in many countries that, for a fair settlement on the Middle East issues, Israel must discontinue its attacks against Palestine and suppression of Palestinians and the United States must not use double standards. 
	
	
 As seen in the above, the world's public sentiment stands on the side of justice. The denunciation and rejection of injustice and the support and encouragement to justice, evident in the February international developments, do reflect change in the 21st-century international relations in which imperialists are weakening and aspirations to independence are strengthening. The general situation in the new century is making turns in favor of the independent developments of progressive nations including our country.

Ariel Sharon would want the Israeli public to believe that it is a war out there and that the Palestinians are bent on destroying the state of Israel. This is the only way he can keep the support of his coalition government and the general public. Israelis are not expected to abandon their prime minister in the middle of a war! And as long as this pretence of a vicious war against Israel holds, Sharon can keep his waning grip on power for more time. 
	
	
 But the truth of the matter is that Israel and the Palestinians are not at war. Palestine is not an independent state with an army that may soon, if unchecked, march into the streets of Tel Aviv or overrun Jerusalem. Israel already occupies the West Bank and Gaza Strip and has done so since June 1967, when Israel and neighboring Arab states fought a six-day war. In October 1973 Israel fought a real war on two fronts, one against Syria and the other against Egypt. In 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon and its troops reached Beirut in a one-sided war that was aimed at destroying the PLO and burying Palestinian claims to their land for good. 
	
	
 Throughout these wars and invasions, the West Bank and Gaza Strip and millions of Palestinian inhabitants succumbed under the mighty stranglehold of Israeli occupation. Little has changed since then. Palestinian territories remain under occupation and the political process that was launched in the early 1990's to end it has floundered. 
	
	
 The first popular uprising, the Intifada, of 1987 and then the second one, which erupted 18 months ago, were desperate means by conquered Palestinians to end the occupation. They are also legitimate options of national liberation. Those who say the Palestinians had never tried non-violent means of resistance forget that they had endured more than 20 years of occupation pleading their cases before their occupiers and world public opinion. In 1987, they revolted, resorting to stones, demonstrations and strikes, and the Israelis responded swiftly by breaking their limbs and shooting unarmed civilian demonstrators in cold blood. 
	
	
 The Palestine Human Rights Information Group reported at the end of 1993 that ""since the start of the first Intifada, Israeli troops and settlers had killed 1283 Palestinians. An estimated 130,472 Palestinians had been injured, 481 expelled, 22,088 held without trial, 2533 houses demolished or sealed and, equally important for the eventual division of the land, 184,257 Palestinian trees uprooted."" Throughout these years Israel kept on building new settlements or ""fattening"" existing ones and expropriating Palestinians lands. 
	
	
 It is a fact that Palestinians are becoming more militant and that the nature of their resistance to occupation is changing dramatically. But it is not war by any military definition. In the past 18 months more than 1200 Palestinians have been killed, mostly civilians, and mostly in their homes, camps, offices, schools, and factories -- not on the battlefield. Many thousands were maimed and injured, hundreds of homes demolished and thousands of hectares of farmland destroyed. If these statistics amount to anything, they point to the continuing waste of human life and property that millions of Palestinians under occupation endure on a daily basis. 
	
	
 Sharon would want to describe his aggression as a war. He would want to show the Israelis that they will not be safe unless his army escalates that aggression to a point where the Palestinians would beg for surrender. But judging from how the cycle of violence accelerated in the past few weeks, the war that the former general wants to ignite is not going to come. Instead, he has invented a reality that is much worse than war. It is chaos bordering on a binge of wanton killing that is achieving nothing in political or military terms for either side. What Sharon has succeeded in doing is to radicalize the Palestinians even further. And by applying the pressure cooker effect he will only reap sporadic but painful retaliatory responses from young and hateful Palestinians who seek liberation in death rather than staying alive under occupation. 
	
	
 Sharon is managing and sustaining a pogrom that puts every Jew and every Israeli to shame, because the enemy for Sharon's soldiers is largely invisible. Their shells and bullets are gunning down innocent people on daily basis. Palestinian reprisals also hurt innocent Israelis because Sharon and his policies have made every Israeli an enemy and a target. 
	
	
 There is no war other than the blind and murderous rage of a defeated colonial power. Against the backdrop of a brutal occupation, the only war that Sharon is waging is against the only possible salvation, which is an eventual peaceful coexistence between two peoples who will have to learn to accept and to share the same land.

(CORR)Spanish premier, EU leader urge Russia to ratify Kyoto Protocol 
	
	
 (Correcting ""handed over"" in line 2 to read ""sent"". Corrected version follows.) 
	
	
 Text of report by Spanish news agency Efe 
	
	
 Barcelona, 14 March: The current president of the EU, Jose Maria Aznar, and the president of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, have sent a letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin in which they urge him to promote the ratification by Russia of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. In the letter, to which Efe has had access, Aznar and Prodi explain that on 4 March the council of EU environment ministers agreed the adoption of a decision for approval of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change on behalf of the European Community. They explain that this agreement is an important step for the EU in fulfilling the political pledge to achieve ratification of the Protocol before the Johannesburg summit on sustainable development. To this end, Aznar and Prodi report that only the internal ratification processes in each of the member states have now to be concluded and they emphasize that these are at an advanced stage and in some cases have been completed. ""Therefore, we have complete confidence that the instruments of ratification of the European Community and of the 15 member states will be able to be lodged with the Secretariat of the United Nations within the time scale anticipated, in other words, in early June of this year,"" they add. However, the letter emphasizes that for the Kyoto Protocol to be able to enter into force in the near future it is not enough for EU ratification to be guaranteed and they thus urge Putin to ensure that Russia also moves ahead with ratification. They make this request ""convinced of the Russian Federation's resolute commitment to the Kyoto Protocol"" and believing that in this manner the EU and Russia would continue to show the ""leadership"" which they believe they have shared ""with such fruitful results, in international cooperation in the fight against climate change"".

Hamburg -- Some 200 German Border Guard officers working in cooperation with the Hamburg prosecutors' office on Wednesday cracked a ring of Afghan smugglers who have been operating throughout Europe. 
	
	
 Officials say that the smuggling ring had been illegally bringing fellow nationals into Germany via Austria since at least October 2001. Many of the refugees then travelled by rail from Hamburg to Britain via Brussels. Others took trains, vans and cars onto ferries destined for Scandinavia. The Afghans paid gang members up to 9,000 euros ($7,900) to make the trip. 
	
	
 The border guard officers searched a total of 16 apartments, stores and offices downtown and in Hamburg's Altona, Billstedt, Schnelsen, and Harburg districts, detaining 14 suspects. An arrest warrant for the suspected leader of the gang, an Afghan, was also served. Police seized 33,9000 euros -- believed to be earnings from smuggling operations -- in the apartment of the 35-year-old suspected ringleader. 
	
	
 Two men who were working with him, an Afghan and a Pakistani, were arrested as well. Eleven others were taken into custody, seven of whom were also members of the smuggling ring. The remaining four turned out to be Afghan refugees. A further four suspects were arrested in a similar operation in Frankfurt. 
	
	
 Police interrogators were told the refugees had been ""parked"" and were working illegally in northern Germany until they could be moved to other locations. 
	
	
 Sites in the towns of Ratzeburg and Uelzen were also searched in connection with the raid, said Wieland Mozdzynski, director of the Hamburg office of the border guard. 
	
	
 Mr. Mozdzynski said that during the operation, which stretched as far as the state of Bavaria and Austria, police had uncovered an ""international network of groups, each with specific tasks."" He added that the groups worked independently, but exploited existing contacts regularly. According to a police spokesman, more than 500 officers took part in the joint operation. 
	
	
 Another officer said the loose structure of the smuggling ring made the investigation more difficult. He said that the bust was nevertheless a significant and successful strike against gangs and businesses engaged in human smuggling.

Harare, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Despite the shortcomings of incumbent President Robert Mugabe's rule which has seen Zimbabwe's economic decline in recent years, the 78-year-old leader has carried off the palm in the country's closest-fought presidential election since independence 22 years ago. 
	
	
 The nationwide polling results, released by the country's electoral authorities Wednesday, gave Mugabe of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union -- Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) 1,685, 212 votes, or 56 percent, against his closest rival, Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), with 1, 258,401 votes, or 41.7 percent. 
	
	
 ""I am 77 years old, but I am still going strong. My fist carries a force, which can make one tumble and roll over 77 times,"" Mugabe boasted in a recent rally. 
	
	
 After defending his ""crown"" to his last-ditch efforts, the veteran statesman, who bragged him a ""young old man"" with abundant reserves of energy to continue ruling Zimbabwe, has finally won the political boxing match against Tsvangirai, a more youthful opponent, who celebrated his 50th birthday on Sunday. 
	
	
 Analysts said Mugabe, the last of the old African nationalists who rode to power on the colonial winds of change, has won on the strength of the appeal of ZANU-PF's land policy, under which the government was seizing idle farms from white farmers, who own the bulk of the country's arable land, to resettle landless peasants. 
	
	
 They said the re-elected president received much of his votes from the rural areas, where voter turnout was considered much higher than that in towns and cities. 
	
	
 Their comments were echoed by rural voters, who said the majority of them, who voted for ZANU-PF, were voting for land, and they will get it. 
	
	
 ""People in the rural areas support the ruling party because our party has been genuine on its policy on land reform. The government has been giving us land and that will win us votes,"" said Kudakwashe Mapfumo, whose family was among the first beneficiaries of the land reform. 
	
	
 ""We were given a piece of land which my parents have been able to farm and provide us with food,"" said Mapfumo, a ZANU-PF activist. 
	
	
 Analysts said another reason for Mugabe to win the poll is his wise campaign strategy. 
	
	
 Mugabe, whose strongholds are in the countryside, took election campaign to urban areas, where Tsvangirai enjoyed much support among those urban workers. 
	
	
 While depending heavily on his rural support, Mugabe told thousands of urbanizers he would focus on housing and job creation if re-elected. 
	
	
 ""We want to come up with policies that will result in the creation of more jobs for the youths and those leaving school and colleges. The issue of good housing and similar services is also a top priority of the government,"" Mugabe said in a recent rally held in the capital Harare, the biggest political fortress for the MDC party. 
	
	
 Of the 1,685,212 votes Mugabe garnered, there are some more votes coming from towns and cities, which were boosting his lead in the crucial poll. 
	
	
 Despite the economic hardships and food shortages currently experienced by Zimbabweans, analysts said there are other major achievements Mugabe's government is credited for. 
	
	
 During Mugabe's 22-year-rule, the country used to boast of having a good education system and a good health system, which was to some extent affected by the lackluster economy. However, a large number of middle-aged people, who benefited from Mugabe's reign, are still nostalgic about the lost time and voted for him with a strong hope for economic revival. 
	
	
 Although some things have gone wrong under ZANU-PF leadership, Zimbabweans still chose Mugabe, the political strong man, because they said they were lured by his Millennium Economic Recovery Program. 
	
	
 Under his blueprint, the government hopes to stabilize the economy through curtailing state expenditure, reforming public enterprises and expanding agriculture.

Nairobi, March 13 (XINHUA) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's reelection has been praised by the Organization of African Unity (OAU), African countries, but condemned by some western countries. 
	
	
 The OAU observer team in Zimbabwe described the election held on March 9-11 as ""free and fair."" 
	
	
 ""On the basis of observations made during the voting, verification and counting process on the ground and objective realities, the OAU observer team wishes to state that in general the elections were transparent, credible, free and fair,"" the team's leader Gertrude Mongella said. 
	
	
 In his congratulation message to his Zimbabwean counterpart Robert Mugabe, Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa calls him a champion of democracy. 
	
	
 ""I am pleased to send my warm congratulations on the renewed and the deserved presidential mandate the people of Zimbabwe have given you,"" Mkapa said. 
	
	
 ""It would be a great tragedy for anyone to determine the outcome of an African election in Europe,"" Mkapa said. 
	
	
 ""It was upon the people of Zimbabwe to decide who should lead them and they have done that loudly and clearly."" 
	
	
 ""The people of Zimbabwe have re-elected you because you have been same (consistent) in defending their inalienable rights to their country's freedom, democratic and sovereign government,"" Mkapa said. 
	
	
 Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi congratulated Mugabe on his reelection, saying his victory and that of his ZANU-PF party was "" testimony of the confidence and high esteem the people of Zimbabwe hold in you"". 
	
	
 Within the 14-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC), a team from the SADC Council of Ministers considered that the vote in Zimbabwe was a ""true reflection"" of the people's will. 
	
	
 The chief SADC parliamentary observer Duke Lefhoko said that "" the results are the affair of the people of Zimbabwe."" 
	
	
 The SADC Council of Ministers in a statement appeals to the people of Zimbabwe to accept the results. 
	
	
 The South African government in a statement welcomes the fact that the actual elections and subsequent processes have proceeded without any significant conflict among the participants. 
	
	
 The statement said, according to the Preliminary Report of the South African Observer Mission, Zimbabwe's elections should be considered as legitimate. 
	
	
 The Nigerian government, a key player in Africa's reaction to events in Zimbabwe, will announce on Thursday its verdict on the elections, Information Minister Jerry Gana said. 
	
	
 However, Zimbabwe's presidential election was condemned by some western countries. 
	
	
 US Assistant Secretary for African affairs Walter Kansteiner in a statement called Zimbabwe's election flawed, saying that the US would consider further sanctions against Mugabe and his government. 
	
	
 British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said ""for months the government of Zimbabwe has conducted a systematic campaign of violence and intimidation, designed to achieve an outcome -- power at all costs."" 
	
	
 He said that Mugabe has ""stolen"" Zimbabwe's vote, an outcome that would have ""enormous implications for the nature of UK-Zimbabwe relationship."" 
	
	
 France's Foreign Ministry spokesman Francois Rivasseau said that Zimbabwe's ""election cannot be considered as substantially free and fair."" 
	
	
 Germany's Foreign Ministry spokesman Andreas Michaelis said that ""all information points to the fact it cannot be assumed there were equal chances for the candidates in this election."" 
	
	
 Denmark's Foreign Minister Per Stig Moeller said his government will cut aid to Zimbabwe and likely shut down its embassy in Harare. 
	
	
 He also said the European Union will consider toughening sanctions on the Mugabe regime when foreign ministers meet ahead of the Barcelona summit on Friday and Saturday. 
	
	
 Denmark gave Zimbabwe aid worth 9.42 million euros (8.3 million US dollars) in 2001 and made available 2 million euros more in 2002 to complete projects already underway. 
	
	
 Zimbabwe's incumbent President Robert Mugabe has won the country's closest-fought presidential election since independence 22 years ago, the final election results showed Wednesday. 
	
	
 According to the nationwide election results, Mugabe gained 56.2 percent of the total 2,998,758 valid votes, or 1,685,212 votes, while Morgan Tsvangirai of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) getting 41.96 percent, or 1,258,401 votes. 
	
	
 About 3.4 million of the 5.6 million registered voters in Zimbabwe were estimated to have voted in the controversial election that ended Monday after a high court extended the voting into a third day.

A detailed document has been issued after China's recent State of Council session [as published]. In the document serious criticism was made on the expanding military presence by the United States at the international level and it was demanded that the United States should stop the policy of dominating the world. 
	
	
 After the 11 September suicide bomb attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the United States, instead of investigating the matter and coming up with proof, put all the blame for terrorism on Afghanistan. As a result, the United States formed a coalition with the aim of bringing an end to terrorism and the Taliban, due to which bombardment is still continuing in Afghanistan. In this operation, the manner in which defenseless, innocent and poor Muslims were blown up by ammunition is one of the most dreadful events in history. The whole world witnessed this loathsome action by the United States, but no one--including the Muslim community--raised a voice against this horrifying act of oppression. Encouraged by the global community's shameful silence, the United States has announced the second phase of its war against terrorism. By declaring Iraq, Iran and North Korea as 'axis of evil', the United States has announced to target these countries in the same manner as !
Afghanistan. North Korea has also been made the target due to the reason that according to the United States, it is being blamed for transferring nuclear technology and weapons to Islamic countries. The seven countries which the US terms as a threat to its security and against which it can use nuclear weapons, also include Russia and China. 
	
	
 The above-mentioned statement by China is the first ever by an important country after the 11 September events in the United States. In the document, the United States has been very openly told that it has become the number one country in damaging solidarity of other countries and violating human rights there. The Iranian President Mohammed Khatami, on the start of his visit to Austria, protested against this dictatorial move by the United States. He also condemned the statement made by President Bush terming Iran, Iraq and North Korea as 'axis of evil' and that these countries are preparing weapons of mass destruction. 
	
	
 Apparently President Bush's attitude looks like a reaction to the events of 11 September 2001. American intellectual Noam Chomsky has proved in his writings that the accomplishment of its goals by aggression and terrorism is a part of the American psyche. This can be traced back to the events in 1818, when American cowboys used blind force to oppress the blacks. Since then, the United States has been raising artificial slogans of preservation of democracy and human rights and developing standards of living. The actual US objective is the protection of its own interests worldwide for which it does not care for any moral values. 
	
	
 According to the analysis of Chomsky, after World War II, the US think tank had planned to subjugate a few regions of the world for its economic progress. The Middle East and many countries of the Third World were part of the plan. During the same period, anti-Soviet hysteria was also promoted strongly. The CIA was given the task to topple governments and install rulers of its own choice. As a result, the governments in Guatemala in 1954 and 1963, Dominican Republic in 1984, Brazil in 1965 and that of Chile in 1973 were toppled. 
	
	
 It has been clearly mentioned in various documents including the US National Security Council memorandum number 68 issued in 1950, that US supremacy has to be maintained at any cost. It can be derived from this that the US attack on Afghanistan without any logic, was not an impulsive action but the psychology of maintaining US supremacy was fully involved in it. It is possible that the United States itself planned this suicidal attack. 
	
	
 It is due to this hegemony, which the United States wants to maintain, that its State Department makes an assessment of the human rights situation in different countries and prepares a report on their violations all over the world. The United States has never tried to make a self-assessment. After the 11 September events, the United States completely ignored the international convention of human rights and by doing so negated its own constitution. After the events in Washington and New York, approximately 1,000 Pakistanis were thrown into jail, and one person, Mohammed Butt, died of heart failure during detention. No court case was made against the others arrested nor they were given the right to defend themselves. Five hundred Taliban prisoners arrested from Afghanistan are being kept in cages on an island near Cuba. These prisoners have been placed in inhuman conditions and the reason for keeping them on this island is that US law does not apply there. As a lesson to others!
, various American TV channels, daily, show shots of the conditions under which these prisoners are being kept. 
	
	
 Above all, the US media has reported that the involvement of Jews in the 11 September events cannot be ruled out. The media also reported that 120 Israeli spies were arrested and were exiled from the United States on the orders of the Department of Justice. This not only shows the double standards of the US but also its selfishness. This also exposes the background of keeping the US troops and military basis in different parts of the world. 
	
	
 Therefore, China is justified in demanding that the United States, by creating conflicts and by embarking upon the policy of oppression and supremacy should stop interfering in the affairs of other countries in the name of human rights. According to China, the American society is engulfed by violence and crime. Racial prejudice has assumed alarming proportions. There is no protection of women rights including their respect and sanctity. 
	
	
 This report [above-mentioned document by China] should be an eye opener for the whole world and the United States should be viewed in its true perspective. Pakistan also needs to rethink in this regard. The way in which Pakistan has been fully supporting the United States after 11 September 2001--the total benefit of that has been earned by the United States. Pakistan has not only earned a bad name but also its internal and external problems have increased manifold. Pakistan should draw its own conclusions in the light of its own circumstances, from this report issued by China. Instead of blindly accepting every demand made by the United States and responding positively to every American phone call, Pakistan should take every single step carefully.

US President Bush is being criticized by world social circles for having called our country, Iran, and Iraq an axis of evil. 
	
	
 On 15 February, the Cuban Government issued a statement denouncing the United States for trying to inflict military threat on the DPRK, Iran, and Iraq, on the pretext of their support or toleration of terrorism. The statement said that the international community would not accept the groundless US condemnation of the DPRK, Iraq, and Iran. Noting that threatening others with armed forces is the current US administration's modus operandi, the statement stressed that the US threat would cause grave clashes. 
	
	
 In his 15 February interview with the French newspaper Figaro, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov assessed the branding of the DPRK, Iran, and Iraq as an axis of evil a Cold War labeling. He pointed out that such labeling is a Cold War heritage. 
	
	
 According to Japan's Mainichi Shimbun, Spanish Prime Minister Aznar in a press conference expressed a stance to distance himself from Bush's view depicting the DPRK, Iran, and Iraq as an axis of evil. He said that it was time to discuss the United States' new diplomatic plans. 
	
	
 In relation to Bush's axis of evil remarks, the German Foreign Minister also said, ""Allies are not satellites,"" and the French Foreign Minister caustically criticized that ""the United States' unilateral, simplistic worldview poses a new threat to the world."" 
	
	
 In its 9 February editorial entitled ""the World of Good and Evil,"" the influential newspaper Financial Times of the United Kingdom stressed that the United States should listen to the friendly countries' criticism of Bush's remarks calling the DPRK, Iran, and Iraq an axis of evil. 
	
	
 On 1 March, Cambodia's Reaksmei Campuchea reported that Bush said that he intends to wage anti-terror wars everywhere in the world, that Iran, Iraq, and the DPRK form an axis of evil, and that he will launch strikes against the countries threatening the security of the United States. The report divulged that the US intention is to realize its own strategy because it has been driven into a corner. 
	
	
 In a 17 February article entitled ""US-Europe Relations at a Crossroads Over the Axis of Evil Theory,"" Japan's Mainichi Shimbun reported that questions are mushrooming in Europe and Russia about the Bush administration's international strategy calling for a showdown with the axis of evil. The article conveyed that the Foreign Minister of Germany, which leads the European Union along with France, said, ""The formation of an international anti-terror alliance does not mean it can do anything."" The article said that the German Foreign Minister's remark expressed a concern, as it were, over the US Government's axis of evil theory. 
	
	
 According to ITAR-TASS, a famous Russian politician (Piacheslav Nikonov), president of political fund, said that it would be hard to imagine something more ineffective than Bush's axis of evil dogma, and went on to point out the following: In recent years on the Korean peninsula, all efforts were channeled to promote dialogue between the North and the South. The US stance, however, makes the dialogue impossible. This remark also infringes on Russia's interests. Bush's dogma astonished the world. By publicly designating countries and their peoples, not some terrorist elements or organizations, enemies of mankind, the United States is taking the risk of confronting itself with all the other countries in the world. 
	
	
 On 19 February, the Voice of Russia reported in the following manner: 
	
	
 The European allies of the United States are not sympathetic towards President Bush's remarks branding the DPRK, Iran, and Iraq as an axis of evil. In view of the recent comments made by the state and political leaders of the European countries, we are led to such a conclusion. It seems to be the first time that the European countries have reached such a consensus that they cannot wholly agree with the United States. The [US] newspaper The New York Times reported that a European Union leader evaluated the axis of evil dogma as a despotic, very simplistic, very rash, and a futile one. The French Foreign Minister also said that the United States is viewing all the problems against the backdrop of anti-terror struggle, thereby seeing the world in a simplistic way. He stressed that the United States is acting arbitrarily, without consulting with other countries, because it is pursuing its own exclusive interests. He stated that the international anti-terror alliance could not be turned into a base on which to take some actions in opposition to other countries. On 17 February, the Finnish and Belgian Foreign Ministers also expressed opposition to the so-called axis of evil remark and the US plan to launch strikes against Iraq. It is hard to forecast how much longer the United States can act arbitrarily and treat its allies and the large majority of the world community in a disdaining manner. Every effort is called for to prevent the US action that could cause great misfortune to the whole mankind. 
	
	
 The broadcasting station reported in the preceding manner.

Sharp divisions between Western countries, Africa emerge 
	
	
 Political Reporters - SHARP divisions between Western countries and Africa have emerged over the fate of Zimbabwe's presidential election results while China has thrown its weight behind President Mugabe. 
	
	
 The United States, Britain and several Western countries declared that the outcome was illegitimate while African leaders and China upheld the elections. 
	
	
 The United States, which has already imposed sanctions on the country, was quick to say that President Mugabe had systematically subverted democracy, with other European nations saying that there were signs the country's presidential poll was deeply ""flawed"". 
	
	
 In stark contrast, election observers from black African nations Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Kenya and Namibia endorsed the vote that returned President Mugabe to power for a fifth successive term. 
	
	
 US Secretary of State Colin Powell said Washington was considering new sanctions following the results of the March 9-11 election. 
	
	
 He said there was overwhelming evidence that polling was neither free nor fair. 
	
	
 ""The pre-election period was marked by a sustained Government-orchestrated campaign of intimidation and violence, and the numerous and profound irregularities in the electoral process itself resulted in an outcome that does not reflect the will of the people of Zimbabwe,"" Powell said. 
	
	
 He said that for more than two years President Mugabe's administration had ""systematically subverted democratic principles and processes"" and his actions had resulted in thousands of Zimbabweans being disenfranchised. 
	
	
 However, local political scientists yesterday said the comments coming from the US and some Western countries were not surprising, as they had already made their decisions not to accept President Mugabe's victory before the election. 
	
	
 Dr Ibbo Mandaza, the chairman of the Southern African Regional Institute for Policy Studies and editor-in-chief of the Zimbabwe Mirror, blamed the media and some sections of the academia whom he said ""acted in collusion with people outside the country with their own agenda against this country and tried to shape perceptions about the developments in Zimbabwe"". 
	
	
 He said there was also too much interference from the British, especially over the issue of land. 
	
	
 Dr Mandaza ruled out any possibility of a rebellion, saying that the vanquished had no such capacity since they were the minority. 
	
	
 Committed 
	
	
 ""The West can't do anything about Zimbabwe as long as the people of Zimbabwe are committed to see this country prosper. There won't be a rebellion because the majority voted for President Mugabe. They don't have the capacity and in any case it is not necessary,"" he said. 
	
	
 University of Zimbabwe lecturer Dr Vimbai Chivaura said Africa had never had the same interests with the West and it would be foolhardy for one to expect them to give a favourable comment over the presidential elections. 
	
	
 ""Our interests have nothing to do with how people report about us. The West is our enemy and it would be surprising if they gave any favourable comment about us,"" he said. 
	
	
 Dr Chivaura said the fact that the majority of Zimbabweans had voted for President Mugabe indicated that they were not concerned about what the British or the Americans were going to do. 
	
	
 ""We don't have to worry. We should continue with our business as usual and we can't expect the Commonwealth to say something positive about Zimbabwe when its head is the Queen,"" Dr Chivaura said. 
	
	
 The reaction from Western governments, according to Reuters, was in stark contrast to remarks by election observers from Nigeria, South Africa and Namibia. 
	
	
 A Nigerian group said it had recorded no incident serious enough to threaten the integrity of the election and South African observers described the poll as ""legitimate"". Namibia's observer team said the election was ""watertight, without room for rigging"". 
	
	
 An observer team from the Organisation of African Unity hailed the election as ""transparent, credible, free and fair"". 
	
	
 Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi congratulated President Mugabe, saying his victory was ""testimony of the confidence and high esteem the people of Zimbabwe hold you in"". 
	
	
 The congratulatory message carried by South African Vice-President Mr Jacob Zuma was an affirmation of the southern African countries' recognition of the elections. This deals a blow to Western reliance on South Africa to transmit their sanctions message. 
	
	
 Mr Mbeki's stance on the elections signals a oneness that the continent has not enjoyed in the past and lack of which the West has exploited to put into power their puppets. 
	
	
 As events unfold in Zimbabwe and the will of the people is realised with the election of Cde Mugabe, a senior State Department official said Washington was now expected to freeze any assets held by President Mugabe and his close associates in the United States. 
	
	
 However, since this threat was made several months ago, the European Union and the United States have failed to produce any evidence that President Mugabe had such foreign assets. 
	
	
 The Zimbabwean President has dismissed these allegations and openly invited these countries to confiscate whatever they find. The United States and European Union imposed a travel ban on the Zimbabwean leadership last month in a bid to bolster the chances of the opposition MDC candidate, Morgan Tsvangirai, of winning the elections. 
	
	
 UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan acknowledged he was getting conflicting reports about whether the poll was conducted fairly, and urged Zimbabweans to refrain from violence. 
	
	
 Triumphed 
	
	
 Some European governments appeared to be holding fire until the EU had reviewed reports from poll observers, but none expressed surprise that Cde Mugabe had triumphed over challenger Morgan Tsvangirai. 
	
	
 Norway, which had 25 observers during the poll, was one of the first European states to openly denounce the election. 
	
	
 ""The presidential election in Zimbabwe has not satisfied the fundamental requirements for a democratic election,"" Foreign Minister Jan Petersen said in a statement. 
	
	
 British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told reporters: ""For months, the Government of Zimbabwe has conducted a systematic campaign of violence and intimidation, designed to achieve an outcome - power at all costs."" 
	
	
 He declined to say what action Britain, the former colonial power, would now take, but said it was consulting the EU and the Commonwealth. 
	
	
 France and Germany also said early information pointed to the vote failing to be free and fair. 
	
	
 President Mugabe won 56 percent of the vote against 42 percent for Mr Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change. 
	
	
 Mr Tsvangirai accused President Mugabe, in power for the past 22 years, of systematically stealing the election by using intimidation, special laws and dirty tricks. 
	
	
 Human rights group Amnesty International said it was concerned about the high risk of violence in the aftermath of the election, particularly against opposition supporters. 
	
	
 ""Action should be taken to ensure that the post- election period is free from the human rights abuses that have marred the run-up to the presidential elections,"" it said. 
	
	
 ""Military presence is being built up in towns such as Bulawayo, Gweru and Kwekwe and human rights defenders are coming under increased threat,"" it said. 
	
	
 Observers from the 14-member Southern Africa Development Community's (Sadc) Parliamentary Forum, which was financed by the European Union after it was kicked out of the country, said: ""The electoral process could not be said to have adequately complied with the norms and standards for elections in the Sadc region."" 
	
	
 Australian observers said they feared violence if voters thought the election had been stolen. But no violence has occurred so far. 
	
	
 Nigeria, South Africa and Australia were mandated by the Commonwealth to report on the poll after the 54-nation group failed to agree to suspend Zimbabwe at its summit last month. 
	
	
 New Zealand said on Wednesday it stood ready to impose sanctions if the Commonwealth chose not to suspend Harare. 
	
	
 Canada said it was still studying observers' reports, but Prime Minister Jean Chretien told parliament: ""I agree ...it does not look very good"".

2 observer groups funded by EU 
	
	
 Herald Reporter - TWO observer groups that have been critical of the just ended presidential election were funded by the European Union, it has been learnt. 
	
	
 Diplomatic sources yesterday said the Southern African Development Community (Sadc) Parliamentary Forum observer mission and the Zimbabwe Election Support Network (ZESN) were funded by the EU, which was kicked out of Zimbabwe and denied the opportunity to observe the election. 
	
	
 The two groups have criticised the election process with the Sadc Parliamentary Forum saying it did not meet the regional grouping's standards on elections. But the Sadc Ministerial Task Force said the election was free and fair. 
	
	
 The foreign-funded local NGO, ZESN, described the poll as chaotic. 
	
	
 According to the sources, the EU which was barred by the Government from observing the election because some of its members were openly supporting the MDC, sent a Ms Maria Macchiaverna to ""support the financial management of our assistance"" to the Sadc Parliamentary Forum and ZESN. 
	
	
 The sources said the EU advised the Government of the arrival of the official in a letter dated March 8, seeking assistance for her to be cleared by immigration authorities. 
	
	
 ""This explains why the two groups were critical of the election. They were paid and asked to paint a bad picture and they have done it. It is easy to paint a bad picture because one can do it even with eyes closed since one would have been paid to do so,"" the sources said. 
	
	
 Despite these negative reports, most observer groups have declared the election free and fair. 
	
	
 The Sadc ministerial observer team yesterday congratulated President Mugabe on his victory. 
	
	
 The team met President Mugabe at Zimbabwe House where it briefed him of its opinion that the presidential election was substantially free and fair, despite a view to the contrary by the West. 
	
	
 Speaking on behalf of the team, Angolan Deputy Information and Social Services Minister Mr Manuel Augusto said Africa was best qualified to judge the poll because some Western countries had prejudged the outcome. 
	
	
 ""I don't know of any Sadc country that two months ago already said that X or Y would win the election but we know countries that two months ago predicted the result of the election. 
	
	
 ""The Europeans have their own views on Africa and we have our own on Africa. We will leave Zimbabwe with a sense of accomplishment after observing the election,"" he told reporters after meeting Cde Mugabe. 
	
	
 He added: ""We came to witness the election, to observe. We didn't come to vote and the results of the election were the true will of the Zimbabwean people. We saw the same thing but with different views which is normal."" 
	
	
 The Tanzanian and Democratic Republic of Congo observer teams also met President Mugabe to congratulate him on his victory and said the election had been free and fair.

CAPE TOWN March 14 Sapa SA ADOPTS CALM AND FORWARD-LOOKING APPROACH TO ZIM 
	
	
 President Thabo Mbeki and the South African government had adopted a serious, calm and forward-looking approach to Zimbabwe, a government statement said on Thursday night. 
	
	
 For a second day since President Robert Mugabe swept to victory in a controversial poll, Mbeki again avoided pronouncing on the freeness and fairness of the election. 
	
	
 Mbeki is one of three world leaders who has to decide on behalf of the Commonwealth whether punitive action should be taken against Harare. 
	
	
 The president was still consulting world leaders and assessing a host of observer mission reports, the statement said. 
	
	
 ""On the basis of all these reports and consultations, and proceeding from the principle that South Africa will act as part of a collective international effort, a comprehensive statement will be made in due course. 
	
	
 ""The South African government believes the most urgent challenge is to work with the Zimbabwean people for economic recovery and social stability, and to promote a climate for national unity in pursuit of these objectives. 
	
	
 ""This is in the interest of our country, our region and our continent,"" the statement said. 
	
	
 Mbeki was in constant consultation with Commonwealth secretary-general Don McKinnon and Nigeria's President Olusegun Obasanjo and Australia's Prime Minister John Howard, it said. 
	
	
 Mbeki, Obasanjo and Howard were mandated at the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Australia, to decide on Zimbabwe's fate once the Commonwealth observers mission submitted its report on the presidential election. 
	
	
 Earlier on Thursday, the Commonwealth observer team said in an interim report that ""the conditions in Zimbabwe did not adequately allow free and fair expression of will by the electorate"". 
	
	
 All eyes are now on the Commonwealth troika on whether it will decide that the Mugabe government should be penalised. 
	
	
 In terms of the Commonwealth's mandate, action against Zimbabwe could range from collective disapproval to suspension should it be decided that Mugabe was returned to power undemocratically. 
	
	
 The South African government had taken note of the reports from various observer missions, including the Commonwealth, which had also urged ""all Zimbabweans to put aside their differences and to work together for the future of the country"", the statement said. 
	
	
 Other reports included one from the Southern African Development Community's council of ministers who declared the election ""substantially free and fair"" and the other from the Organisation of African Unity which said ""in general the elections were transparent, credible, free and fair"". 
	
	
 The government had also noted the SA Observer Mission (SAOM) report which had found that although the election was not adequately free and fair, it should be considered legitimate, the statement said. 
	
	
 The statement was silent on the SADC parliamentary observer team report which said the regional bloc's own election norms and standards -- which Zimbabwe was signatory to -- had not been met. 
	
	
 It confirmed that Deputy President Jacob Zuma had been sent as Mbeki's special emissary to Harare on Thursday and said this was a result of Pretoria's ""serious, calm and forward-looking approach"". 
	
	
 Zuma's spokeswoman Lakela Kaunda told Sapa, the deputy president had given Mugabe a special message from Mbeki and congratulated him on his re-election, based on the SAOM's interim report. 
	
	
 Kaunda declined to give details and said Zuma would report back to Mbeki later on Thursday. 
	
	
 Zuma was accompanied by Labour Minister Membathisi Mdladlana, who served on the Southern African Development Community ministerial task team on Zimbabwe. 
	
	
 Zuma also held talks with his Zimbabwean counterpart Simon Muzenda. 
	
	
 Foreign news agencies said Zuma told Zimbabwean state radio on his arrival in Harare on Thursday that ""those discrediting Zimbabwe's electoral process should listen to what the Africans are saying"". 
	
	
 He said the South African government was happy with the SAOM report that the elections were legitimate. 
	
	
 SAOM head Sam Motsuenyane said in a radio interview on Thursday that although the election was legitimate it stopped short of being free and fair. 
	
	
 He was unable to explain the apparent contradiction. 
	
	
 In a statement released later on Thursday, Kaunda said Zuma's visit was part of ongoing consultation between the two governments. 
	
	
 Zuma had informed Mugabe of the SAOM report and that it was part of a process involving various bodies such as SADC, the OAU and the Commonwealth. 
	
	
 As a member of these organisations, South Africa would await these reports before responding definitively on the issue. 
	
	
 ""Both the Deputy President and President Mugabe agreed on the need for continued consultation and co-operation between the two governments to address economic matters such as the shortage of grain, and continued co-operation, trade and investments and a number of other bilateral issues."" 
	
	
 Zuma also pledged continued support for Zimbabwe and its people, she said.

A Middle East settlement still remains one of the international issues drawing global attention today. 
	
	
 The world's justice- and peace-loving peoples are unanimously demanding a fair and peaceful Middle East settlement to be at the earliest possible date. 
	
	
 However, Israeli Zionists, counting on the support and protection provided by the United States, continue to obstruct such a settlement, continue to key up tensions in the region. 
	
	
 The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught: 
	
	
 ""For a peaceful and fair settlement on the Palestinian issue and the issue of the Middle East, the Israeli aggressors should withdraw from all Arab land they occupy and the Palestinian people should be fully guaranteed the right to self-determination."" 
	
	
 The Middle East issue, essentially, is an issue of reinstating the Palestinians' national rights and of recovering the deprived Arab land from the Israeli aggressors. 
	
	
 For a comprehensive fair settlement on the issue, it is required, first of all, that the Palestinians are guaranteed the right to self-determination, that the founding of an independent Palestinian state is realized, and the Israeli aggressors withdraw from all the Arab land they occupy illegally, including Golan Heights. 
	
	
 However, instead of withdrawing from the Arab land they occupy by force, the wily Israeli aggressors, dreaming of the creation of a ""great Israeli empire,"" are scheming to make it their land permanently. They continue to stir up troubles in areas they occupy, creating further complications in the situation. Typical examples are the acts of aggression and savage atrocities perpetrated by Israeli troops in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which are under the Palestinian Authority's control. 
	
	
 According to reports, Israeli tanks, in the middle of the night on 20 February, attacked the eastern part of Gaza City housing the key facilities of the Palestinian Authority, shelling and destroying Palestinian broadcasting center, among other things. Israeli forces, at the same time, attacked the southern Gaza town of Rafah. As a result, at least four Palestinians were reportedly killed and more than 30 wounded. 
	
	
 Between the night of 20 February through the dawn next day, Israel's F-16s and helicopters struck the ""(POS)-17"" facility of presidential security guards adjacent to the building housing the directorate of the Palestinian Authority, plus the Palestinian autonomous police station in the West Bank town of Jenin. 
	
	
 On the same day, the Israeli army blocked off major highways linking Palestinian cities in the West Bank area and roads linking these cities to neighboring villages. 
	
	
 Earlier, Israel had launched fierce assaults on Palestinian targets in the Gaza Strip and West Bank areas. As a result, l4 Palestinians were killed, according to foreign press reports. 
	
	
 Because of the intensification of Israel-Palestinian armed conflicts in the recent period, not a single day would pass in peace and with no Palestinians shedding blood in the West Bank and Gaza Strip areas. 
	
	
 In this situation, the ""Peace and Security Council,"" organized by Israel's retired military officers and former high officials of security agencies, launched a movement calling for the unilateral withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank and Gaza Strip areas. As seen in this and other developments, criticisms of Prime Minister Sharon's hard-line military policy against the Palestinians are mounting inside Israel. Eighty percent of the members of the ""Peace and Security Council,"" made up by retired military officers and former high officials of Mossad, Israel's foreign intelligence agency, and Shin Bet, its domestic intelligence agency, are demanding that Israel dismantle Jewish ""settlements"" in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, numbering approximately 50; that it unilaterally withdraw its troops from good many areas occupied by them; and that it promptly reopen the peace negotiations with the Palestinians. The fact that, in Israel, former high-ranking figures of the military and of law enforcement and intelligence agencies are getting increasingly critical of Sharon is likely to have a great impact on the situation in the future, according to foreign press comments. 
	
	
 Israeli newspapers, which earlier refrained from censuring Sharon, have come forward attacking him with scathing criticisms such as that he is ""unwilling to take any options other than the military hard-line, victimizing the lives of both Israeli and Palestinian men in the street."" Nevertheless, Sharon refuses to modify his hard-line posture, saying that ""we must win this war."" 
	
	
 Behind the incursions and atrocities of oppression Israel is perpetrating against the Palestinians today, there is the fact that the United States is supporting and protecting it. 
	
	
 The United States, while handing over to Israel billions of dollars in lethal weapons every year, stands on the Israeli side in dealing with the Middle East situation. 
	
	
 Foreign press reports, poking fun at the United States and Israel, say that they are of ""one body with two heads,"" ""Israel is a spoiled brat of the United States,"" or that ""Israel is one of the US states."" 
	
	
 Israel and the United States should bear their due responsibility for the daily deteriorating Middle East situation and quit its moves to obstruct a fair Middle East settlement.

Following the presidential vote in Zimbabwe, there is just one thing Robert Mugabe cannot be reproached for, and that is having made a secret of his determination to stay in power by every possible means. The electoral hijacking had been announced, prepared, and organized. It has now taken place. Should one be surprised? Since he nearly lost his parliamentary majority in June 2000, the head of state has stated and restated to his supporters that the presidential election was going to be a ""war."" He was as good as his word. 
	
	
 The ""war for land"" continued, at the risk of causing famine. The army swore allegiance to the ""father of independence,"" regardless of the verdict at the ballot box. The independence of Zimbabwe's justice system was compromised. The local press was harassed. The opposition MDC (Movement for Democratic Change) was the victim of ""state terrorism"" that its candidate Morgan Tsvangirai rightly condemned after being beaten in an election loaded against him from start to finish, from drawing up the electoral lists to counting the votes. The real secret of the ballot box will never be revealed. 
	
	
 This ""fait accompli"" in Zimbabwe is a challenge for the international community. It can only rise to meet it by making some radical changes. Indignant protests apart, nothing was done to prevent the disaster awaiting one of the key countries in southern Africa, seen as the continent's growth pole. The weapon of so-called ""intelligent"" sanctions proved ineffective, especially as the punitive measures were taken too late and only served to deny Robert Mugabe and his associates trips abroad and access to the funds they have spirited away. They amounted to no more than a ban on holidays and a golden retirement. Finally and most importantly, Great Britain remained locked in the familiar psychodrama between the former colonizer and colonized. Africa, with its own ""observers,"" has just ratified a shameful electoral sham. Kenya and Tanzania even ""congratulated"" Robert Mugabe on his re-election after the first round. 
	
	
 It is time to speak the language of truth. Either the absence of democracy in Africa is no longer any more of a problem for Europe than the lack of development, or it is time to get serious about ""good governance"" as a condition for aid. Either the New Partnership for African Development (Nepad) is merely to entertain the international gallery during the occasional conference on ""sustainable development"" or Africa must itself impose a minimum of probity and respect for fundamental liberties. It has the means. Robert Mugabe remains in power thanks to the maize, oil, and electricity he supplies to South Africa. In Zimbabwe it is better to have an end to the torment than torment without end. 
	
	
 Fortunately, Europe is no longer ""Africa's policeman."" But it must demand that the countries of Africa put their own house in order.

JOHANNESBURG March 16 Sapa MBEKI TO MEET WITH MUGABE AND TSVANGIRAI IN HARARE ON MONDAY 
	
	
 (CORRECTS TITLE OF AUSTRALIAN PM, UPDATES WITH ZUMA ATTENDING INAUGURATION) President Thabo Mbeki would fly to Harare on Monday to meet Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and later with opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, presidential spokesman Bheki Khumalo told Sapa on Saturday. 
	
	
 Khumalo said Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo would also attend the talks, which would culminate on Tuesday when the two met Australian Prime Minister John Howard in London. Mugabe was to be inaugurated again as Zimbabwean president on Sunday following his controversial re-election last weekend. He was first elected Prime Minister in 1980 and has effectively ruled the country ever since. 
	
	
 Mbeki, Obasanjo and Howard have been mandated by the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Australia to decide what action should be taken on the situation in Zimbabwe. Their decision would be based on the Commonwealth observer team's report on the legitimacy of the election as well as those prepared by the Southern African Development Community, the Organisation of African Unity and the SA Observer Mission. The Commonwealth team earlier this week said that ""the conditions in Zimbabwe did not adequately allow the free and fair expression of will by the electorate"". 
	
	
 The SADC on Saturday endorsed the vote, despite its Parliamentary Forum, which judging that the March 9-11 election ""did not conform with the norms and standards of the SADC Parliamentary Forum,"" signed on to by Zimbabwe. The team from the organisation's Council of Ministers, on the other hand, considered the vote a ""true reflection"" of the people's will. 
	
	
 The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) also backed Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's re-election, with its observer team describing the poll as ""transparent, credible, free and fair"". South Africa's observer mission also endorsed the vote, saying in an interim report that ""(o)verall ... the authorities charged with conducting the elections discharged their work satisfactorily."" The team acknowledged that the election campaign had been characterised by ""polarisation, tension and incidents of violence and intimidation."" In terms of the Commonwealth's mandate, action against Zimbabwe could range from collective disapproval to suspension. 
	
	
 Mbeki was, however, already on the record as saying that the Commonwealth also had other issues to consider. CHOGM had also decided to look at ways of helping Zimbabwe with land reform and food aid. State-sanctioned land invasions, several times declared illegal by Zimbabwe's courts, as well as a drought have disrupted Zimbabwe's food production and famine is already looming in much of the country. 
	
	
 Meanwhile, Foreign Affairs spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said Mbeki's deputy, Jacob Zuma would represent the country at the controversially re-elected President Robert Mugabe's latest inauguration, scheduled for Sunday in Harare. No reason was provided why Mbeki could not attend. Reports from Lagos indicated that Obasanjo would also not attend. 
	
	
 Several other heads of state had by Saturday indicated they would attend, including Tanzania's Benjamin Nkapa and Malawi's Bakili Muluzi, currently also the SADC's president. Mamoepa said the key points on the agenda now was Zimbabwe's economic recovery and social stability ""within the context of national unity.""

Islamabad, March 18, IRNA - Central Leader of Pakistan People Party (PPP) and former provincial minister of North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) Seyed Qamar Abbas has rejected US state department report on Human Rights in Iran and other countries, saying America has no right to make such a report as it is itself the violator of human rights. He told IRNA in an interview on Monday, ""America has killed thousands of innocent people in almost all parts of the globe particularly in the Muslim world. America, in the guise of its so-called war on terror, has killed and injured thousands of innocent Afghans and the prisoners of war are maltreated."" A couple of weeks ago, the US state department in its annual report had revealed that Iran, Pakistan and some other countries are the violators of human rights. ""America has a double standard policy. It denounces human rights violation but supports Israel for perishing the Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon,"" Abbas criticized. He said those countries and nations which are independant in real sense of the world and do not take dictation from the US or accepts its supremacy are labelled as human rights violators. ""Those who submit to its policies are showered upon favours,"" he added. ""America always follows its interests. In its so-called war against terrorism and against weapons of mass destruction lies its covert motive and that is its strategic and economic interests,"" Abbas added. However, he hoped that the people of the world can no more be kept in dark. ""They can see and observe the unjust and discriminatory policies of America. People do not believe whatever the America says,"" he concluded.

Harare, March 17 (XINHUA) -- Despite Western pressure on him over his re-election victory, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe was sworn in on Sunday as the country's head of state to serve another six-year term. 
	
	
 With a 21-gun salute sounding and four fighter jets sweeping overhead, the colorful inauguration took place amid thunderous applause by thousands of ruling party supporters. 
	
	
 Chief Justice Godfrey Chidyausiku presided over the swearing-in ceremony, which was witnessed by leaders of some other African countries, including Malawian President Bakili Muluzi, Namibian President Sam Nujoma, Democratic Republic of the Congo President Joseph Kabila, Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano, Tanzanian President Benjamin Mukapa, South African Vice-President Jacob Zuma, Zambian Vice-President Enock Kavendele. 
	
	
 Zimbabwe's top judge, who was dressing in British-style scarlet and black robes and shoulder-length horsehair judicial wigs, bedecked Mugabe with a red sash of office. 
	
	
 ""I, Robert Gabriel Mugabe do swear that I will be faithful to the laws of the Republic of Zimbabwe, so help me God,"" said Mugabe who was flanked by first lady Grace. 
	
	
 Mugabe, who is from the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), won last weekend's presidential election by polling 1,685,212 against his closest rival Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) who polled 1,262,401 votes. 
	
	
 At the State House, where the ceremony was held, thousands of ZANU-PF supporters in clothing emblazoned with Mugabe's portrait, were singing and dancing to celebrate his victory, with a hope that Mugabe will finally deliver on his promises to give them the land currently owned by the country's white minority. 
	
	
 In his inauguration speech shortly after he was sworn in as president, Mugabe vowed to continue with his government's controversial land reform program. 
	
	
 He told thousands of cheering supporters that ""land reforms must proceed with greater speed and strength"" to shore up the economy, badly battered by years of political instability. 
	
	
 He said the program, under which the government was taking over idle farms from white farmers, who own the bulk of Zimbabwe's arable land, to resettle landless blacks, would form the centerpiece of his efforts to revive the economy. 
	
	
 ""We want to make sure that blacks play a meaningful role in the economy, and we will do that through the land reforms,"" said Mugabe. 
	
	
 In the run-up to the March 9-11 poll, critics had accused the Zimbabwean leader of stirring up the emotive land issue merely to garner support in the country's closest-fought election since independence in 1980. 
	
	
 But he told the nation that in spite of stiff opposition to the agrarian reforms from powerful Western countries, especially the country's former colonial power of Britain, he would press ahead to seize farms from whites and resettle blacks. 
	
	
 ""That message has not been accepted in Britain, that Zimbabwe is for Zimbabweans. This is our land, and we have no intention of owning a piece of land in Britain,"" said Mugabe. 
	
	
 He described his victory in the poll as ""a stunning blow to imperialism"" and thanked African countries for supporting Zimbabwe in its stand-off with Western countries over the agrarian reforms. 
	
	
 Many African leaders have supported Mugabe's re-election victory in Zimbabwe's crucial election, which they said was "" transparent, credible, free and fair"". 
	
	
 Mugabe said Zimbabwe needed their continued support against what he called hostile international attention. 
	
	
 ""When they aim at Zimbabwe, it is not Zimbabwe alone, they have other countries in mind."" 
	
	
 In his campaign for re-election, the Zimbabwean leader repeatedly accused Britain and its Western allies of trying to re-assert neocolonial rule in Zimbabwe, and the region, by installing a compliant opposition party in power. 
	
	
 ""Thanks to the people, our people and the people of Africa for this joint effort in rejecting this neocolonial attempt. Africa is for Africans,"" said Mugabe. 
	
	
 However, Mugabe is under strong regional pressure to form a government of national unity, incorporating his closest rival in the poll, to ensure political and economic stability in Zimbabwe. 
	
	
 South African President Thabo Mbeki and President Olusegun Obasanjo are expected in Harare Monday for talks with the Zimbabwean leader on a possible government of national unity. 
	
	
 The two, along with Australian Prime Minister John Howard, are members of a Commonwealth panel charged with assessing the election and recommending possible action by the group against Zimbabwe. The panel was scheduled to meet in London on Tuesday. 
	
	
 Diplomats here said a government of national unity was partly intended to allow Britain and the United States to save face over their insistence on the MDC' s victory in Zimbabwe's election. 
	
	
 The European Union (EU) and the US have joined the opposition in alleging the election was neither free nor fair and threatened more sanctions on Zimbabwe. 
	
	
 A final communique issued on Saturday evening after the Barcelona EU summit said, ""The European Union will maintain its humanitarian assistance to the people of Zimbabwe and will consider possible additional targeted measures against its government."" 
	
	
 Sunday's inauguration ceremony was boycotted by EU countries, the US and some members of the Commonwealth. 
	
	
 Also, the opposition's 57 members of parliament stayed away. 
	
	
 In his inaugural address, Mugabe extended an olive branch to the opposition to join him in rebuilding the country's economy, which has suffered three years of consecutive decline, but did not say in what role. 
	
	
 ""Our energy is better spent on reviving the economy than plotting to bring down each other,"" he said. 
	
	
 ""The call to all of us, whether in the ruling party or in the opposition, is that we unite and come together as one people. There are areas where we must work together because we have a common destiny,"" said Mugabe. 
	
	
 The MDC party rejected the voting results, claiming the government rigged the poll in favor of incumbent President Mugabe. 
	
	
 MDC leader Tsvangirai said pre-election violence prevented his party from campaigning in rural areas, the stronghold of the ruling party, and that thousands of his supporters in towns were disenfranchised when they failed to vote because authorities reduced polling centers in urban areas. 
	
	
 The ZANU-PF government denied rigging the election, saying Mugabe won on the strength of the appeal of ZANU-PF's land policy. 
	
	
 Analysts said Mugabe received much of his votes from the rural areas, where voter turnout was considered much higher than in towns and cities.

US Ambassador to Indonesia Ralph L. Boyce praised the Indonesian government on Monday [18 Mar] for its efforts to protect foreign investors in the country, including Americans, but warned that investors were still concerned about the security of their investments. 
	
	
 Boyce acknowledged that the Indonesian government had taken serious steps to ensure the personal safety of American investors and other foreigners, who appeared at risk several months ago during the political tension following the US-led war against Afghanistan's Taliban regime. 
	
	
 ""We take seriously the government's responsibility to protect Americans -- not only Americans but also other foreigners in Indonesia. We welcome it."" 
	
	
 But, he said, ""Investors will come to Indonesia not based on fears, somehow, that they would be physically threatened, but rather in the hope that the capital invested in Indonesia would be secure and that means transparency, rule of law, protection legally, etc.,"" Boyce told a press conference. 
	
	
 Some local radical groups threatened to attack U.S. interests and citizens in Indonesia following the U.S. government's move to strike at Afghanistan several months ago. 
	
	
 Some U.S. companies temporarily closed their offices here following the threats. 
	
	
 But the government was quick to give assurances about the safety of foreign workers in Indonesia. 
	
	
 Boyce, along with 12 members of the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Singapore, earlier met with President Megawati Soekarnoputri and Minister of Trade and Industry Rini M. Soewandi. 
	
	
 The AmCham delegation is in Indonesia for a two-day visit to assess business opportunities in this country. The delegation is led by AmCham Singapore president Landis W. Hicks. 
	
	
 The delegates include Tan Hup Thye from Refco Singapore Pte Ltd., Stuart Dean of GE International, and Edward Gilbert of Merrill Lynch (Asia Pacific) Ltd. 
	
	
 ""The Singapore-based members of this mission want to hear from senior members of the Indonesian government about efforts to expand foreign business participation in the economy. We know that Indonesia is a country of enormous potential and believe that now is the time to build our future together,"" Hicks said in a statement. 
	
	
 Meanwhile, Rini said after a meeting with the AmCham delegation that almost all of the delegation members had praised the current security situation in the country. 
	
	
 Rini said she had pointed to the Batam and Bintan islands as secure places for doing business, citing the small number of labour disputes in both islands.

The UN International Conference on Financing for Development opened in Monterrey on 18 March (Telam photo) 
	
	
 Monterrey, Mexico--Choked, hushed voices, some of them astounded, are not guessing correctly about the dilemma of the chicken or the egg into which the Argentine crisis has become converted, almost grotesquely: will the International Monetary Fund (IMF) endorse concrete aid to the country, apart from the presumable good intentions of its board members and technicians, without the approval of George W. Bush? 
	
	
 ""Certainly not,"" was the comment made in a private dialogue with La Nacion by a diplomatic source from the United States who, with a legion of colleagues, is attending the United Nations Conference on Financing for Development that opened yesterday in Monterrey, Mexico. 
	
	
 And, while striding hastily through the large facilities of the International Business Center (Cintermex), he sketched an explanation: ""Argentina is the leading case of an era in which everyone pays dearly for his mistakes, and somehow manages as best he can. If someone earns 1,000 and spends 1,500, he will inevitably succumb to bankruptcy. The same thing is happening to the countries now. However, since this is a new concept, there may be room for negotiation."" 
	
	
 Apparently not in Monterrey, where Bush will have a full agenda, and without contacts with other chief executives, except for Mexico's President Vicente Fox, and Canada's Prime Minister Jean Chretien, since they are trading partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). ""Well, one never knows,"" slipped in the source, becoming lost on an escalator. 
	
	
 Eduardo Duhalde's agenda, during his first departure from the country since he assumed the presidency, calls for a key meeting on Friday with the IMF's managing director, Horst Koehler, (which he will attend accompanied by Economy Minister Jorge Remes Lenicov), and two occasions on which he will have the floor, addressing the world (for five minutes on one, and three minutes on the other) concerning the topic under discussion; the Monterrey Consensus: or greater assistance from the developed countries to those that are underdeveloped, which in fact will be approved by consensus. 
	
	
 As soon as he arrives on Wednesday, Duhalde will meet with Fox, perhaps spearheading the explanation of the Argentine situation to Bush: a possibility that is not entirely clear among the Mexican officials, especially since, in principle, the virtual plan will have to take place step by step. ""First I listen, and then I will see,"" commented one of them to La Nacion. It was learned that Foreign Minister Carlos Ruckauf and Foreign Secretary Jorge Castaneda may already have talked about this. 
	
	
 More Political Than Economic 
	
	
 It is common knowledge, among most of the small groups, that the Argentine crisis is more political than economic, and that, as one Latin American diplomat accredited to the UN remarked, the formula in question does not hold much mystery: ""A rapprochement with the United States is indispensable, because it is the only one that can extricate them from this."" 
	
	
 Very well. How? With a strategy that would permit Duhalde, if he does not receive a clear signal from the IMF, not to call for elections in 90 days, for example, and to become a lame duck, waiting for his successor, he explained. 
	
	
 The source commented: ""Argentine is in a position to be an alternative reference point for the United States, to the detriment of Brazil which, in view of the internal and external vicissitudes facing Fernando Henrique Cardoso, is, day by day, becoming somewhat weak."" 
	
	
 These are geostrategic plans at moments when time is exerting pressure, and also pressing the speed at which the world turns. With 58 chief executives immersed in signing a document which, as La Nacion was told by the Argentine ambassador to the United Nations, Arnoldo Listre, gives a clue to the direction in which we are heading: ""It shows a new organization in which the market economy is accepted as a fundamental factor for development and, unlike the cold war, is rid of the North-South confrontation."" 
	
	
 In that document, the Monterrey Consensus, free trade, the amendment on the distortion with agricultural subsidies, and the treatment of the external debt as fundamental pivotal points, benefit Argentina. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan himself said, in his time, that the situation of indebted, undeveloped countries must be consideed, so as to avoid the repetition of a crisis such as ours. In the documents, Argentina ranks in 59th place for its per capita income: $7,440, according to the World Bank's report on development: a substantially devalued figure after the default and the end of the currency board arrangement. Despite this, it gives a clue to the gap that existed, and still exists, between the reality and the statistics of the international credit agencies. 
	
	
 According to some sources, the crisis is in a bind: the IMF is asking for more belt-tightening, and the government is asking for more money. Ergo: without belt-tightening there is no money, and without money there is no belt-tightening. Then what? A source from the United Nations observed ironically: ""If Chile were Iraq, and if President Ricardo Lagos were Saddam Hussein, Argentina would have Bush's full support."" Chile is not Iraq, nor is Lagos Saddam, fortunately, of course.

Some Israeli officials, particularly Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer, have stated that the success or failure of US envoy Zinni's mission hinges on the Palestinians only because they might carry out a suicide or shooting attack that will make Israel retaliate, thus bringing the region back to the cycle of violence. Consequently, Zinni will find it difficult to attain a cease-fire and commence the implementation of the Tenet understandings and Mitchell recommendations. 
	
	
 This allegation contradicts the simplest fact on the ground, as Israel is the one that occupies most of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and Israel is the one that possesses vast military power which it uses to make incursions into and raid Palestinian cities and refugee camps; to intimidate women and children; to assassinate innocent activists and citizens; to destroy buildings, facilities, infrastructure, roads, water pipes, and electricity and telephone poles; to attack Palestinian ambulances and kill medical teams; and to carry out other retaliatory, suppressive, and devastating practices. 
	
	
 The entire world -- not the Palestinians alone -- is waiting to hear an official Israeli statement regarding its recognition of the Palestinian national rights and its readiness to withdraw from all lands occupied in 1967, put an end to the settlement activity in the West Bank and Gaza, and support the establishment of an independent Palestinian state de facto. Such a statement will actually constitute the beginning of a real era of peace and the end of the era of violence and counterviolence. Clearly, the Palestinian side has acceded to all demands -- even more than that -- when it recognized Israel's right to exist on 78 percent of historical Palestine. It cannot make more concessions. Such an Israeli statement would not only serve Zinni's mission but would also accelerate the attainment of a permanent arrangement in which Israel would gain peace and security in exchange for its withdrawal from the Palestinian lands, the end of its colonialist occupation, and the renunciation of its mentality of domination and expansion, which have caused calamities and catastrophes in the past five decades. 
	
	
 The coming days and weeks will show whether Israel is actually ready to positively and objectively deal with the Palestinian national rights without trying to maneuver, place obstacles, or set impossible conditions during Zinni's mission. In any case, Zinni's mission is to make sure that certain measures are adopted as soon as possible to pave the road to a political settlement of the Palestinian question. Israel's compliance with the required commitments will be the real test not only of its readiness to facilitate the US envoy's mission but also its readiness to establish a just peace which is in the interest of all parties concerned.

It has now become our right to announce clearly that the United States had become one of the sides of the axis of evil according to the same criteria set by the United States itself, and declared by its President George Bush. Namely that the countries of the axis of evil, from his point of view, are those that produce, develop, and amass weapons of mass destruction in a way that threatens the security and stability of its neighbors, as well as all the countries in the world. 
	
	
 Thus, after the US mass media and newspapers revealed the report by the Pentagon that listed seven countries to be attacked with US atomic weapons in case US national security was threatened, it became clear that the United States develops and produces weapons of mass destruction to threaten the stability and security of the world, and that it violates the United Nations Charter attacking independent and sovereign nations. 
	
	
 Of course the second side in the US axis is Israel, and definitely the third side will go to no one but Britain, as it conforms to the same criteria and because it completely supports the US stance and considers it the absolute right in all cases. The countries of the US axis are similar, for they cooperate, are joined by a strategic bond, and each defends the other and supports it with words and deeds. We can review, for example, the voting results in the Security Council to see how Washington always defends Israel, then how Britain always justifies the stances by both countries in admirable harmony. 
	
	
 Therefore, the United States endeavors hard to save Israel from the serious crisis that Sharon has put himself into. Thus roles were distributed specifically and clearly, and each role was drawn accurately and with care, exactly as was the case in the great movie ""The Second Wife"" between the tyrannical mayor with power, Abu-al-Ila, the simple peasant who owns nothing but the clothes on his back and a gang of children, and his wife, who was coveted by the mayor. 
	
	
 Immediately a neutral intermediate appears, represented in the fake imposter Shaykh, who is the friend of the mayor in the axis of evil. Then you find a dramatic portrayal of the reversed situation in which the Shaykh, or in this case the ""US,"" Anthony Zinni, advises Abu-al-Ila, ""Palestinian,"" to bow and accept the mayor's, ""Israel's,"" demands, or else he would be convicted of possessing weapons of destruction in the eyes of the authorities. So now we only wait for the advice of Haj Zinni to obey those in authority, so that we would not become terrorists like Iraq, North Korea, and Iran!

Beijing, 19 Mar (Wen Wei Po)--In response to the US decision to allow Tang Yao-ming to visit the United States, experts on Taiwan affairs said here in interviews with this reporter that this showed a lack of sincerity by the United States in improving Sino-US relations. If US moves go beyond China's limits of tolerance, it will seriously affect Sino-US diplomatic relations. 
	
	
 Yu Keli, deputy director of the Institute of Taiwan Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences [CASS], said that since taking office, the Bush administration has gone farther and farther in ""interfering in China's internal affairs and meddling in the Taiwan issue"" and has entirely run counter to the aspirations of the two peoples for the healthy development of Sino-US relations. 
	
	
 Sun Yan, assistant professor at the International Relations College of the Beijing University, also held that on the issue of international anti-terror cooperation, the United States wanted to rope in China in order to remove obstacles to its next phase of attack against Iraq. This does not mean that China and the United States have achieved any progress on the Taiwan issue. Compared with the Clinton administration, the Bush administration evidently is in retrogression on the Taiwan issue. 
	
	
 Li Jiaquan, research fellow at the CASS Institute of Taiwan Studies, said: During his visit to China, Bush steered clear of the Sino-US three joint communiques and one China on two important occasions, his joint conference with Jiang Zemin and his speech at Qinghua University. However, in his meetings with Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji, Bush stressed one China and the Sino-US three communiques. The two cases contrast sharply. On public occasions Bush seems to show consideration for the US anti-China forces and pro-Taiwan faction and to even appease Taiwan separatists. ""Bush cannot conduct himself in an upright manner and he speaks insincerely!"" 
	
	
 Li Jiaquan felt that it is very appropriate to quote a line from Guo Moruo, ""confounding right and wrong, being kind to the enemy and hard on friends,"" to describe the United States. Japan's militarism used to be the US enemy, while China used to be a friend of the United States. Now the United States sees her former friend as an enemy and her former enemy as a friend.

LONDON, March 19 (AFP) - The Commonwealth suspended Zimbabwe for one year on Tuesday, taking action against the regime of President Robert Mugabe a week after controversial elections returned him to power. 
	
	
 The surprise decision comes after the 54-nation group failed to reach agreement on sanctions against Harare before the voting, when African leaders rallied around the anti-colonialist Mugabe, who has held power since independence from Britain in 1980. 
	
	
 ""The committee decided to suspend Zimbabwe from the councils of the Commonwealth for one year with immediate effect,"" Australian Prime Minister John Howard told reporters here. 
	
	
 ""This issue will be revisited in 12 months' time,"" he said. The decision, taken by a three-way panel of Howard and presidents Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, follows a damning report on the March 9-11 vote by Commonwealth observers. 
	
	
 The report concluded the poll had been marred by violence, intimidation and suspect electoral practices designed to benefit Mugabe, a conclusion also reached by the Zimbabwean opposition and much of the West. 
	
	
 Zimbabwe's Information Minister Jonathan Moyo immediately blasted the decision to lump his nation in with Pakistan, which is also currently suspended from the Commonwealth. 
	
	
 ""It is a bad report that can only lead to bad decisions,"" Moyo said, denouncing the report as ""opinionated"" and ""one-sided"" and saying it ""lacks credibility and cannot withstand any objective scrutiny."" 
	
	
 A spokesman for British Prime Minister Tony Blair said: ""He clearly welcomes the decision by the Commonwealth troika and believes that it is absolutely the right thing to do."" 
	
	
 Foreign Secretary Jack Straw also praised the decision, saying that ""the message could not be clearer."" 
	
	
 New Zealand Foreign Affairs Minister Phil Goff welcomed the Commonwealth's suspension of Zimbabwe but said New Zealand was likely to impose sanctions anyway. 
	
	
 Goff said that while he welcomed the suspension, it appeared it had been done reluctantly. 
	
	
 ""To some extent we have the sense that this is a halfway house,"" he said. 
	
	
 The panel had been expected to defer or reject calls for Zimbabwe's suspension after Mbeki and Obasanjo held talks Monday with Mugabe and defeated opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, and apparently proposed to mediate in talks between the two sides. 
	
	
 The suspension validates ""our own refusal to accept the result as legitimate,"" said Welshman Ncube, secretary general for Tsvangirai's opposition Movement for Democratic Change. 
	
	
 The suspension came just after Switzerland said it was slapping sanctions on the southern African country, including a freeze on financial assets which might be held by government officials in Swiss banks. 
	
	
 Tsvangirai had earlier suggested that ""Mbeki and Obasanjo are not going to allow that (suspension), they are going to present a position that the Zimbabweans are talking, so there may be a deferment of any action."" 
	
	
 Although Mbeki has not specifically given his own views, an official South African observer team said the election result should be respected. 
	
	
 Tsvangirai, who had been tipped to win a free and fair election, has said he would negotiate with a view to running a fresh election and ""restoring legitimacy"" but on Tuesday he ruled out any ""meaningful discussions"" unless Mugabe's government cracked down on violence. 
	
	
 ""The presidential elections are over,"" the information minister said. ""They were held in terms of our laws and our constitution, and the next election is not for six years."" 
	
	
 Mugabe was declared the winner of the presidential vote with 56 percent of votes to Tsvangirai's 42 percent. 
	
	
 Most international observer groups have condemned the conduct of the poll, as have many Western governments, notably Britain and the United States. 
	
	
 But at a summit in Australia earlier this month ahead of the election, Commonwealth leaders postponed action against Harare over its defiant stance on the presence of certain international observers to monitor the voting. 
	
	
 In his inauguration speech on Sunday, Mugabe promised to accelerate his controversial land reforms begun in July 2000, which aim to resettle blacks on white-owned farms in a bid to reverse colonial-era injustices. 
	
	
 The land reforms have been marred by political violence led by liberation war veterans who support Mugabe. The latest killing of a white farmer, Terry Ford, came just a day after Mugabe's inauguration. 
	
	
 Critics of the land reforms say the measures have also aggravated a food shortage in Zimbabwe that threatens to worsen because of drought. 
	
	
 Washington is still mulling a response to the election and ""continuing its conversations with allied nations about what the proper response should be to the fraudulent election in Zimbabwe,"" said Ari Fleischer, spokesman for US President George W. Bush.

DURBAN March 19 Sapa SA OBSERVER: ZIM ELECTIONS NOT FREE AND FAIR 
	
	
 Another member of the South African Observer Mission to Zimbabwe says the past weekend's presidential election in the southern African country was not free and fair. Methodist Bishop Purity Malinga on Tuesday echoed the sentiments of South Africa's Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) chairwoman Brigalia Bam that Zimbabwe election did not conform to international standards. 
	
	
 Bam on Sunday said she believed Zimbabwe's election was not free and fair, adding they were not in line with international standards as well as those of her organisation. Malinga, who represented South African churches on 50-member mission, told journalists during breakfast at the Diakonia Council of Churches in Durban, that she was uncomfortable with the manner in which the team had been treated -- even before they left South Africa. 
	
	
 ""We were also advised to be vigilant in what we say in private and in public,"" Malinga said. Each member was handed a booklet containing guidelines on Zimbabwean election laws. ""Personally I felt that one is going to be used here, but I nevertheless hoped the presence of outsiders in Zimbabwe would stop some illegal acts which may have been committed."" 
	
	
 The booklet was published by the Electoral Institute of South Africa, in Pretoria. Malinga said according to the guidelines in the booklet, the election had been legitimate. She believed that SAOM head, Dr Sam Motsuenyane had probably based his findings on the guidelines. In a preliminary, Motsuenyane declared the Zimbabwe poll ""legitimate"", adding they could, however, not be openly described as free and fair. 
	
	
 Malinga, who was based in southern Matabeleland near Beitbridge, said the election were characterised by -- among others -- intimidation. ""Even in the queues at polling centres there was a lot of fear and tension. The election was run by the police and the army who carried weapons. Under these circumstances nobody can feel free."" 
	
	
 She said international observers were treated with suspicion by the police. ""At one station were not allowed in and told that we had nothing to do with the Zimbabwe issue. At another station we were ordered to stay at least 100 metres away. Even local observers could not enter these stations,"" she said. 
	
	
 ""Many people were also unable to vote because their names were not on the voters' role. They were turned away in twenties, thirties and fifties."" SAOM on Monday stopped short of declaring the Zimbabwean presidential election free and fair, but the African National Congress majority on the committee declared the poll ""credible"". 
	
	
 The majority report, endorsed only by the ANC, said the observer mission had noted that over three million Zimbabweans had cast their votes and this substantially represented the will of the people. The Inkatha Freedom Party, Democratic Alliance, New National Party, African Christian Democratic Party, the Pan Africanist Congress and the United Christian Democratic Party had disagreed with the ANC conclusion. 
	
	
 The United Democratic Movement was still undecided. Other delegates in SAOM aligned themselves with the findings of the Southern African Development Community parliamentary forum that said the vote had not met SADC's norms and standards. The United States, Britain, local Zimbabwean observers, and the Commonwealth observer team also described the poll as not free and fair.

C'wealth mission conduct questionable 
	
	
 By A Special Correspondent - Britain's Prime Minister, Tony Blair, privately did two things concerning Zimbabwe during the recent ""retreat"" by Commonwealth leaders in Australia that raise questions about today's meeting in London by the troika of Australia, Nigeria and South Africa. 
	
	
 The first was that Blair said he had received an interim report from the Commonwealth observer mission to Zimbabwe that condemned the outcome of the presidential election - before Zimbabweans had even had a chance to vote. 
	
	
 But how could Blair have ""a Commonwealth report"" when no one else had received such a report that should be channeled through the Secretariat to all members, asked one of the other 53 Commonwealth leaders at the retreat? 
	
	
 The British leader fudged his reply and the Commonwealth leaders were left with the distinct impression that the ""Blair report"" had already been written in London before the Commonwealth mission even left for Zimbabwe. Their mission was simply to rubber stamp the adverse report that Britain had already written. 
	
	
 Blair's second faux pas in Australia, according to some of the assembled Commonwealth leaders, came in his response to a remarkably conciliatory speech by Zimbabwe's Foreign Minister, Dr Stan Mudenge. 
	
	
 The Nigerian leader, President Olusegun Obasanjo, had urged the minister not to attack Blair frontally over Britain's negative position regarding Zimbabwe, but to deal with the presidential election preparations in a dispassionate and precise manner. 
	
	
 The Zimbabwean minister did this. Then Mudenge rose to his feet, strode over to Blair and thrust out his hand. 
	
	
 The hand symbolised reconciliation; and Blair accepted it. Then Mudenge proposed that Britain and Zimbabwe bury past differences and work together in the future. 
	
	
 The Commonwealth leaders, many of them in the first place unable to understand the dispute between Zimbabwe and its former coloniser, Britain, breathed a collective sigh of relief at what they hoped was the beginning of the healing process. 
	
	
 But there was still an unanswered question in the minds of the Commonwealth leaders: How had the British Prime Minister seen the purported ""Commonwealth report on Zimbabwe"" when they had not? 
	
	
 Meanwhile, back in Harare, some strange things were happening with the Commonwealth mission. 
	
	
 They had been pre-booked by the Zimbabwean Ministry of Foreign Affairs into the partly Government-owned Sheraton Hotel. 
	
	
 On the spurious grounds that the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-PF) election campaign centre was in an adjoining building, the Commonwealth observers moved out to the privately owned Meikles Hotel. 
	
	
 There, unlike the Sheraton where the national newspaper The Herald is distributed to guests, the pro-opposition Daily News is given freely to guests. 
	
	
 Furthermore, as anyone who has been following the Zimbabwean Press can testify, many of the Meikles farms around the country have been acquired by the State as part of the land reform programme. Meikles Hotel has long been known as a hot bed of opposition politics. 
	
	
 During the 2000 parliamentary elections, 80 rooms at Meikles Hotel were booked by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). 
	
	
 But because of their openly hostile position towards the President and Government, the BBC was refused accreditation to cover the presidential election. 
	
	
 While the Commonwealth observer mission and many of the foreign journalists were assembled in the hotel, the opposition leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Morgan Tsvangirai, moved in with them, taking a complete floor for himself and his entourage. 
	
	
 It is notable that the Commonwealth observer mission did not move again although the opposition had now joined them in the same hotel. 
	
	
 There was also the curious appointment of and behaviour by individual members of the Commonwealth mission who should have been sworn to secrecy as part of their mission and who should have expressed their views only through the chair of the mission. 
	
	
 Instead, an Australian member of the Federal Parliament, Julie Bishop, vented her anger towards the President and Government, and the electoral process, in Australia's media. 
	
	
 The composition of the Commonwealth mission raised further questions. Why were several former and recent employees of the Commonwealth Secretariat accredited as observers? Normally staff make up the Secretariat in support of a mission populated by more eminent, neutral persons. 
	
	
 A Namibian woman member of the Commonwealth observer mission, who is the well-respected, Deputy Speaker of the National Council in her country, held different views to those stated in the interim Commonwealth report that was released only after the election results were known. 
	
	
 Although the Commonwealth missions nominally operate on the basis of ""consensus"", she and others of a similar view were dismissed as ""troublemakers"" by one of the former Secretariat staff-cum-observer. 
	
	
 The final straw that confirmed that Australia had abandoned any pretence of fairness to all sides in the dispute came when the Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, ordered his High Commissioner in Harare not to attend Sunday's inauguration of Robert Mugabe as President of Zimbabwe. 
	
	
 The Australians, in common with other white members of the Commonwealth, the European Union (EU), the Americans, Norwegians and the Swiss stayed away from that event saying they do not recognise the election and therefore Mugabe as the head of State. 
	
	
 These are some of the realities that Presidents Obasanjo of Nigeria and Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, confronted as they flew from Harare last night for their meeting in London tomorrow with the Australian leader who is the third member of the Commonwealth troika. 
	
	
 Howard, however, will not be isolated at the three-member meeting at Marlborough House in London. 
	
	
 The Commonwealth Secretary-General, Don McKinnon of New Zealand is also known to support his country's decision to condemn Zimbabwe's presidential election. 
	
	
 And close by, Howard will have the British government and the western media. 
	
	
 Presidents Obasanjo and Mbeki, however, have the benefit of their own observer missions to Zimbabwe as well as the support of the vast majority of the Commonwealth. 
	
	
 And, in line with Commonwealth consensus, the views of the majority are taken to be the views of the Commonwealth as a whole. 
	
	
 No doubt Blair will fight on. 
	
	
 But the solution to the present impasse lies with the people of Zimbabwe and Africa, not with the people of Britain and Europe.

Australia's plans to construct a space port on Christmas Island, located just a stone's throw, a mere 500 kilometres south of Jakarta, has concerned some in the Indonesian Government. Although diplomatic overtures to express official objections have not yet been made, the government through the National Space and Flight Agency has already warned of the possible risks facing Indonesia. The nation should certainly be concerned about the plans to build a rocket launch pad, work on the infrastructure for which is due to start in 2002, with launches beginning from 2004. The problem is, this large-scale project right in our own backyard could not only potentially cause space debris consisting of bits of rocket, fuel and satellites to fall into Indonesian territory, but will also disrupt flights and shipping. 
	
	
 If a rocket launch fails, debris weighing hundreds of tonnes will be scattered over the densely-populated island of Java or the tourist island of Bali, and on to the east as far as Timor. 
	
	
 The memory Russia's Mir space station which after 15 years fell to earth on 23 March 2001 is still fresh of. Fortunately shrapnel from the former space station, which measured 33 x 30 x 27 metres and weighed 137 tonnes, burned up as it re-entered the earth's atmosphere somewhere over the Pacific Ocean between Chile and Australia. Nevertheless, intact pieces of debris weighing up to 20 to 30 tonnes fell into the Pacific Ocean. 
	
	
 Prior to that, two Soviet satellites struck the earth. Cosmos 1402 in January 1978 fell over the Northern Hemisphere and Cosmos 954, which contained radioactive substances, crashed above the uninhabited tundra of Canada in September 1977. 
	
	
 Even more worrying is the possibility that a space station could be transformed into a military base and pose a threat to Indonesia's national sovereignty. At such close proximity, if bilateral relations with Australia were to take a turn for the worse, firing at Indonesia would be extremely easy. 
	
	
 On the other hand, Christmas Island is certainly an ideal location for rocket launches due to its proximity to the Equator and the geostationary orbit (GSO). [passage omitted on technical details of operation of GSO] 
	
	
 Notwithstanding the above, in reality only three of the 15 launch pad centres worldwide are located near the Equator - Kourou, San Marco and Sriharikota. But the famous US space centre, the Kennedy Space Centre at Cape Canaveral in Florida is located relatively far from the Equator. Therefore, plans to construct a space port should be moved from Christmas Island if Australia is really willing to listen to Indonesia's objections. 
	
	
 International law governing accountability if one nation's space debris falls on another is already in existence. The main convention is the UN Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects, 28 March 1972, known as the 1972 Liability Convention. 
	
	
 The Convention basically sets out the responsibility of the launching state, either jointly or collectively, for the consequences of a launch failure from the time of launching through to the re-entry of a satellite to the Earth's atmosphere. The Convention also sets out various claims that can be made by states who have suffered damages as a result of other states' space projects. 
	
	
 As the nation most likely to suffer the impact of the Australian Space Port, Indonesia could rely on the simplest article in the Liability Convention, Section 14. This section allows states who have suffered damages to claim compensation through the International Claims Commission, which acts as the representative of the appellant state against the launching state (in this case Australia) or any other international organisation which can be classed as a launching state. 
	
	
 Of course, lodging a claim is not as simple as clapping one's hands. Indonesia at the very least needs to sign the UN Convention on Space as well as ratify several other treaties governing national activities in outer space. 
	
	
 These UN Conventions are the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies 1967 (Space Treaty 1967), the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects 1972 (Liability Convention 1972), and finally, the Convention on Registration of Objections launched into Outer Space 1974 (Registration Convention 1974). 
	
	
 So far, the Indonesian Government has only ratified the 1972 Liability Convention. This convention only applies to space objects that fall into Indonesian sovereign territory. Indonesia has only adopted one compensation principle, the Absolute Liability principle. This principle means that the burden of proof that the claimant state has suffered damages does not lie on the state submitting its damages claim. It is sufficient at law to demonstrate the fact of the damage caused as a result of the space object identified as belonging to the launching state or a state that has participated in the space object launching. 
	
	
 A National Space and Flight Agency working paper suggest a high degree of difficulty if Indonesia, as a state that has suffered damage, were to lodge a damages claim. In the case of objections to the Christmas Island space station, Indonesia would need to be able to show that damage that has occurred within its territorial area was caused by space objects launched from the Christmas Island station. This would of course require advanced technology and great cost to bring the matter to a claim submission. 
	
	
 But in conversation with Kompas on Sunday (17 Mar), one of Indonesia's few space law experts, Prof Dr Priyatna Abdurrasyid, expressed a different opinion. Indonesia would not need to produce further evidence to substantiate its claim, he said. It would suffice to submit a claim to the UN Claims Commission and state that the space debris in Indonesia had originated from the Australian space centre. 
	
	
 ""If Australia then denies the claim, we need only demand that Australia produce proof that the space debris did not originate from its space centre activities. If a deadlock in negotiations occurs, the parties can ask the UN Claims Commission as a neutral party to act as adjudicator. This is no different to arbitration hearings to resolve other cases,"" Priyatna said. 
	
	
 Unfortunately, historical precedent shows that claiming compensation is no easy matter. In claiming compensation from the Soviet Union over Cosmos 954, Canada was forced to navigate numerous procedural complications. This is a very important lesson for Indonesia. 
	
	
 Unlike other experts, Priyatna believes that Indonesia should not be too concerned [about the Australian planned space station]. ""In principle, my personal opinion is that we shouldn't go against the current. Rather we should the use the current to our mutual benefit,"" he said. 
	
	
 Meaning that rather than challenging and issuing objections to the Australian space project, Indonesia should take advantage of our southern neighbour's space activities. 
	
	
 ""The Space Treaty 1967 obliges launching states to open as widely as possible the opportunity of cooperation with other states in all its activities. The treaty also pledges that the launching of space objects be purely for humanitarian purposes and not for military purposes,"" Priyatna said. 
	
	
 The basic principles of the Space Treaty 1967 oblige Australia as the launching state to open the possibility of humanitarian cooperation in the field of space endeavour. ""Australia is not allowed to prevent other states who want to cooperate on its space centre. Indonesia can exploit this principle of the Space Treaty 1967. Rather than issuing a letter of objection to the Australian Government, wouldn't it be better to join them in our own national interest?"" he asked. 
	
	
 The kangaroo country should implement risk management procedures before opening the space station on Christmas Island, and open as widely as possible the opportunity of cooperation with other states, and open complete access to cooperation to all states without exception. These principles are upheld in the Space Treaty 1967. 
	
	
 Australia should adhere to the Cardinal Principle of International Law, which states that all nations in the world must first respect and promote the humanitarian interests and progress of all humankind. But the problem is, who can ensure that these guidelines will indeed be adhered to?

BETHANY - The number of illegal immigrants in Swaziland seems to be increasing. Last month members of the Umbutfo Swaziland Defence Force [USDF] found 594 illegal aliens in the country. 
	
	
 The USDF found 43 Somalians inside two kombis in Maphiveni and 23 others were found without travel documents at Matsamo border and were handed over to the Horo police. At least 507 illegal Mozambicans have been found, as well as eight South Africans, two Tanzanians, and one Burundian. 
	
	
 According to the army spokesman, Corporal Nhlanhla Dlamini, the key areas where most of the immigrants were found was Lomahasha, Mhlumeni and Sitsatsaweni. ""We have discovered that there is a certain family around Lomahasha, which is suspected of assisting illegal immigrants with shelter and transport. The army would like to request whoever is engaged in this criminal activity, to stop,"" he said. 
	
	
 Last month, 53 cattle were also stolen around the country, of which 17 were spotted inside Mozambique driven by three men armed with rifles thought to be AK47s. The Mozambican soldiers have promised to act quickly. 
	
	
 The USDF also found four stolen cars in different places in the country. These include a Nissan Skyline in Mafutseni, a Mercedes Benz, A Toyota and an Isuzu 2.5 diesel at Nkalashane.

Beijing, March 21 (XINHUA) -- China urged the United States on Thursday to abide by the ""one China policy"", warning that any act to trample upon the Sino-U.S. Joint Communiques could result in a ""very unfavorable"" impact on relations between the two countries. 
	
	
 The question of Taiwan, which relates to China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, is an essential and most important issue and is at the heart of Sino-U.S. relations, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue. 
	
	
 China hopes the United States will not do anything against the spirit of the three Sino-U.S. Joint Communiques, she said. 
	
	
 Zhang made the remarks at a news briefing in response to a question about the Taiwan official Tang Yiau-min's recent visit to the United States. 
	
	
 Zhang replied that Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing has put forward China's stand on the matter while making strong representations to the U.S. government with the hope that the United States treats the matter seriousness it deserves. 
	
	
 She said during the U.S. President Bush's working visit to China last month, state leaders of both countries agreed that Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Vice President Hu Jintao would visit the United States this year. 
	
	
 However, within one month of Bush's visit, the U.S. has already done several things which are against the spirit of the three Sino-U.S. Joint Communiques. 
	
	
 Zhu said the U.S. side should stop interfering in China's internal affairs by interfering in the Taiwan issue.

March 22 (Interfax-AVN) -A habitual criminal who escaped from a convoy and started a shootout in the Perm region overnight to Friday has surrendered to the police, a spokesman for the main police department in the Volga federal district told Interfax-Military News Agency on Friday. Sergei Serdyuk, 32, was convicted several times on charges of theft, assault amd car hijacking. He was detained in March 2002 once again. While being transported to the police department of the Komi- Perm autonomous region on Thursday, Serdyuk escaped from a convoy of the Kochevo police department. The incident happened on the Perm-Kudymkar motorway 6km from the Karagai village of the Perm region at about midnight. Materials contained in the criminal case brought against Serdyuk say that the man disarmed the convoy, got hold of four PM pistols, wounded the head of the criminal investigation subdepartment of the Kochevo police department, who commanded the convoy, captured the driver of the police vehicle and left in the direction of Perm. The car was stopped near the Krasnokamsk village, the shootout started, and Serdyuk escaped in a forest. No casualties were registered among policemen. Two PM pistols were found at the site.

Mugabe must be confronted with constitution issue 
	
	
 Lovemore Madhuku 3/21/02 1:40:54 AM (GMT +2) 
	
	
 IT will be a monumental tragedy for Zimbabwe and the future of the democratisation process if we fail to draw proper and useful lessons from the debacle surrounding the just-concluded presidential election. I must warn at the outset that there are two groups of persons whose analyses must be handled with caution. The first group is the media. The second group is that of ""winning"" and ""losing"" politicians. 
	
	
 These two groups dominated the pre-election period with all sorts of analyses and predictions whose value is yet to be ascertained. 
	
	
 Yet I must declare my interests at the outset. From those very first days sometime in early 1997 when, alongside colleagues like Tendai Biti, Welshman Ncube, Brian Kagoro, Priscilla Misihairabwi, Everjoice Win and Tawanda Mutasa, I participated in formulating the concept of the National Constitutional Assembly (NCA), it has been clear to me that the sole purpose of the current Zimbabwean constitution is to preserve and protect the rule of ZANU PF. 
	
	
 My view then, and indeed those of my colleagues, was that a democratic environment in which free and fair elections are the norm, and in which citizens enjoy real freedoms, could only be created if a new, democratic and people-driven constitution were put in place. In terms of that view, it is almost impossible to change the government through an election conducted in terms of the current constitution. 
	
	
 This is the view I still hold so strongly that I must confess it may cloud my assessment of the just-concluded presidential elections. 
	
	
 There is little doubt that the presidential election was neither free nor fair. An election which fails to meet the standard of being ""free and fair"" produces an illegitimate outcome. 
	
	
 This much must be regarded as admitting of no doubt. However, this says nothing about the way forward. This election was not stolen on March 9 and 10 2002, nor is the outcome illegitimate merely on the allegations of rigging arising from the events of the polling days. 
	
	
 The lesson to be learnt from this poll is that until Zimbabwe has a genuinely democratic constitution enshrining universally recognised norms and institutions for the holding of an election, a free and fair ballot will remain a mirage. 
	
	
 Politicians who in the run-up to the election peddled theories about how the ""will"" of the people would prevail notwithstanding the labyrinth of constitutional provisions loaded against a free and fair election must now admit that they were wrong. Most of the problems faced in this election have their roots in the defective nature of our constitutional framework. I now proceed to illustrate this truth. 
	
	
 First, the voter registration process was not transparent and was conducted in such a way as to favour the ruling party. The main reason for this lack of transparency is that in terms of the current constitution and laws, voter registration is conducted by officials appointed by, and answerable to, the President. 
	
	
 In other countries, this process is handled by an Independent Electoral Commission which is an impartial body and whose independence is guaranteed by the constitution. In our case, the so-called ""supplementary voters' roll"" was nothing but a list of names of ZANU PF supporters compiled under dubious circumstances but it was given legal validity by President Robert Mugabe acting is terms of the current constitution and laws. 
	
	
 Secondly, the designation of polling stations, as is now well known, was specifically done in a way that favoured ZANU PF by granting ridiculously few polling stations in urban areas. This was done by officials appointed by, and answerable to, Mugabe. In other countries, this is done by an Independent Electoral Commission, which is constitutionally enjoined to act impartially. 
	
	
 Third, it is alleged that some key election officials such as presiding officers were Central Intelligence Organisation operatives. In other countries, there is no scope for such madness. An Independent Electoral Commission appoints professional election officials. 
	
	
 Fourth, there were the so-called ""no-go areas"" in Mashonaland Central, West, East and some parts of the Midlands. Parliament also passed the Public Order and Security Act which the police deliberately misinterpreted to suppress the opposition. 
	
	
 Our constitution does not specifically provide for political rights such as free and equal campaigning platforms for competing political parties. If such rights had been enshrined, it would have given the opposition the right to approach the courts for orders directing the police to facilitate free campaigning in the so-called no-go areas. 
	
	
 Fifth, equal access to the public media is not guaranteed by our constitution. This enabled the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation to abuse its position by broadcasting ZANU PF propaganda only. 
	
	
 Finally, and more significantly, the President enjoys enormous powers under the current constitution which he used to further his electoral chances. It was the President who directed that there be tripartite elections in Harare. And in doing this, he overrode court orders to the contrary. 
	
	
 The tripartite elections contributed to what ultimately became a ""low"" turnout in Harare. 
	
	
 After the Supreme Court nullified the General Laws Amendment Act, the President used his powers to reinstate most of its provisions through a statutory instrument. Thus, it was the President who banned postal voting by all Zimbabweans outside their constituencies except members of the army and the police. The latter are alleged to have voted for Mugabe. 
	
	
 The ban on monitoring of elections by civic society was also reinstated. There were other countless examples of the President's use of the powers he enjoys under the current constitution to mould the electoral process in his favour. 
	
	
 The conclusion to be reached from this whole picture is that under the current constitutional and legal framework for the holding of presidential elections, it is almost impossible to vote out an incumbent President. It was naive for the Movement for Democratic Change to believe that the people's anger against Mugabe was, in itself, sufficient to carry the day in an election, whatever the circumstances. 
	
	
 The issue is not about Mugabe. If Mugabe were to announce his retirement before the expiry of his six-year term and ZANU PF were to field any of his less illustrious colleagues as a presidential candidate, without a fundamental change to the rules, Zimbabweans will learn an even more bitter lesson: ZANU PF will ""steal"" that election again. 
	
	
 We do not need to wait for that scenario before we embrace the need to fight for a new constitution. We have learnt our lesson and it will be irresponsible to seek to dispute this clear fact. 
	
	
 This brings us to the way forward. Two points must be made. 
	
	
 First, there has been no spontaneous uprising against Mugabe notwithstanding the widespread disbelief that greeted his victory among many voters, particularly those in urban areas. ZANU PF had anticipated such an uprising, hence the massive intimidatory show of force that was evident in the deployment of security forces in every part of the country during and after the announcement of the election results. 
	
	
 Secondly, key African countries have accepted Mugabe's victory while almost the entire Western world has ""rejected"" the election results. These two points are crucial in any discussion of the way forward. 
	
	
 Various options have been discussed, but the better way forward is to confront the Mugabe regime with the constitutional question. Constitutional reform is at the heart of any new democratic discourse in Zimbabwe. 
	
	
 Mugabe must be forced to yield to a new process of constitutional reform leading to a new constitution. There must be mass action for a new constitution. 
	
	
 Mass action for a new constitution places Mugabe in a difficult situation. He cannot be heard to defend the current constitution, which has been roundly condemned by all. He has used the current constitution to stay in power. 
	
	
 Even the African observers who endorsed Mugabe's re-election have also criticised the constitutional framework governing elections in Zimbabwe. 
	
	
 More fundamentally, the struggle for a new constitution is a question of principle, not personalities. It is a legitimate struggle which Mugabe cannot dismiss as a Western imperialist ploy because its demands are clear and unambiguous: a more democratic system of government, a more democratic framework for conducting elections, an expanded Bill of Rights and so on. 
	
	
 Mugabe has no moral excuse for shooting people merely demanding a new constitution. 
	
	
 The masses required for such a struggle to succeed need not be substantial. This struggle does not need a spontaneous uprising. A core of determined and committed Zimbabweans is sufficient for this purpose. 
	
	
 It is critical that a new constitution be in place as soon as possible so that any future election is held in a transparent and credible manner. 
	
	
 A presidential election is not necessarily six years away. Under the current constitution, the President has no powers to designate a successor, should he decide to retire. A fresh election must be held within 90 days. 
	
	
 The same situation arises if the President dies while in office. Never again should Zimbabweans go into an election under the current constitution. 
	
	
 A criticism which has been levelled against this way forward is that mass action aimed at confronting Mugabe with a demand for a new constitution translates into recognising him when in fact his government is illegitimate. This is useless sophistry. 
	
	
 Mugabe is a political fact. In legal jargon, to those who do not recognise his presidency, he remains the de facto President. It is him who must be confronted with such a demand as constitutional reform. 
	
	
 The NCA last December completed a draft constitution which Mugabe, through Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa, refused to receive. That draft must be forced on Mugabe and the NCA hopes that Zimbabweans will join in this noble cause to put in place a secure framework for good governance in Zimbabwe.

 Text of report in English by Russian news agency ITAR-TASS 
	
	
 Moscow, 24 March: Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov is departing for Mongolia on Sunday afternoon [25 March] on an official visit, the premier's press secretary, Tatyana Razbash, told ITAR-TASS. The official programme of Kasyanov's stay in capital Ulaanbaatar will begin with a tete-a-tete meeting with Mongolian Prime Minister Nambaryn Enhbayar on Monday, followed by talks in an extended format and signing of several agreements. Besides this, the Russian prime minister is scheduled to meet with Mongolian President Natsagiyn Bagabandi and the parliamentary speaker, Sanzhbegiyn Tumur-Ochir. On Tuesday, 26 March, Kasyanov will address Russian and Mongolian entrepreneurs and visit Science and Technology University. He is also expected to be awarded the title of honorary doctor of the university. On Tuesday night, Kasyanov will wind up his Mongolian tour and leave for Vietnam for an official visit. The turnover of goods between Russia and Mongolia has reached 240m dollars. Russia exports petroleum products, electricity, machinery and equipment to Mongolia and imports copper concentrate and meat. Moscow has expressed the wish to import more Mongolian meat. Russia's Ambassador to Mongolia Oleg Derkovskiy believes that there are no problems in relations between the two states and the common border stretching for 3,500 kilometres is a border of peace and good neighbourliness. Moscow and Ulaanbaatar are continuing a political dialogue, actively developing bilateral trade, and consulting each other on international problems where their stands coincide or are close. At the same time, the ambassador said in an interview with ITAR-TASS that large Russian capital and businesses ""are not active enough in dealings with Mongolia"" at the moment.

MOSCOW. March 24 (Interfax) - Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov on Sunday evening is beginning a foreign tour, during which he will pay official visits to Mongolia and Vietnam. He will be visiting Ulan-Bator on March 25 and 26, and Hanoi on March 26 to 28. In Mongolia Kasyanov is to meet with Mongolian Prime Minister Nambaryn Enkhbayar, parliament Chairman Timur Ogir and President Natsagiyin Bagabandi. The plan of Kasyanov's visit also included expanded talks and the signing of bilateral documents. The Russian prime minister will meet with Mongolian and Russian businessmen. The main goal of the visit is to broaden economic cooperation between the two countries, whose present-day pace is not fast enough. Russian-Mongolian trade currently amounts to $240 million and makes up only 25% of Mongolia's foreign trade turnover. Mongolia's negative balance in trade with Russia increased from $150 million in 2000 to $160 million in 2001. Russia has proposed improving the situation by increasing exports of Mongolian meat to Russia. In recent years, three joint ventures - the Erdenet mining company, the Mongolian-Russian Non-Ferrous Metals Company and the Ulan- Bator Railways, have accounted for 60% of the Mongolian exports and 40% of the GDP. Russia would like to increase its stake in Erdenet from the current 49%, but Mongolia is also interested in increasing its 51% stake. This issue is likely to be discussed in Ulan-Bator, since the 1991 agreement on this company expires on December 31, 2002. Among other projects which Russian companies would like to implement in Mongolia are the laying of a gas pipeline from Russia to China (Yukos), the gasification of individual districts of Mongolia (Gazprom, Itera) and electricity exports to Mongolia (Unified Energy Systems of Russia.) Mongolia is one of the few members of the former social camp to which Russia does not owe anything. On the contrary, Mongolia's debt to Russia on current operations amounts to $10 million, and its Soviet-era debt to $11.5 billion. Russia is prepared to discuss restructuring and deferment schemes with the Mongolian leadership. Military cooperation, curtailed in the 1990s and now being resumed, will also be on the agenda. The parties are to discuss the training of Mongolian military personnel at Russian military academies and arms exports. Kasyanov will fly to Hanoi from Ulan-Bator on March 26.

AMMAN -- Authorities on Sunday [24 March] released an alleged business associate of Majd Shamayleh, the prime suspect in a bank fraud case under investigation, on JD1 million bail bond, nearly two weeks after he was detained in connection with this case, judicial sources said yesterday. 
	
	
 Munther Halasa was one of the six detainees suspected of involvement in the questionable bank loans case which the government referred to the State Security Court prosecutor for investigation. 
	
	
 The sources said Halasa also made a deposit of $6 million at the Central Bank of Jordan. 
	
	
 Two other suspects, who are clerks at the HSBC Bank, were released on bail last week. 
	
	
 Halasa and the other two suspects are out on bail pending further investigations, the sources said. 
	
	
 Fifty-five people, including former officials, businessmen and bankers are believed to be involved in the case. 
	
	
 The State Security Court has imposed a ban on news coverage of the investigations, citing Article 38 of the Press and Publications Law.

HONG KONG, March 26 (AFP) - China has disallowed a routine port call in Hong Kong for an American naval vessel, a spokeswoman for the US consulate said Tuesday. 
	
	
 ""The Chinese government denied a requested visit by the USS Curtis Wilbur, a destroyer, to visit Hong Kong from April 5 to 9,"" she said adding, ""this would have been a routine port call."" 
	
	
 ""No reason was given for the disapproval,"" the spokeswoman added. 
	
	
 The bar on the USS Curtis Wilbur with some 346 crew is seen as reflecting Beijing's anger over Washington's decision to allow Taiwanese Defense Minister Tang Yao-ming to visit Florida for a military conference this month. 
	
	
 Beijing has twice summoned the US ambassador for dressings down over the issue, while a state-controlled newspaper reported last week that China was preparing to cancel naval exchanges with the United States in retaliation. 
	
	
 The last time such a request was turned down was in May last year following the collision of a US spy plane with a Chinese fighter jet in international air space over the South China Sea on April 1, 2001. 
	
	
 However, US naval visits to Hong Kong resumed in July. 
	
	
 There were two other similar episodes of permission being denied before that since the 1997 handover of the former British colony to China. 
	
	
 One of them was after the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia was bombed, killing three people, in the US-led NATO air campaign three years ago. 
	
	
 When Hong Kong was under British rule, the US navy made up to 65 port calls a year and Beijing had agreed the stopovers would continue after the territory returned to Chinese sovereignty.

China has launched three unmanned spacecraft consecutively and exhibited to the world the capsules recovered. People have seen the true features of these space capsules. What exactly then is a manned spaceship? 
	
	
 It is learned that the manned spaceship will have a liftoff weight of about eight tonnes, and is less than 10 meters long and 3.5 meters in diameter. It can carry two to three astronauts and continue to cruise in space for more than 20 days. 
	
	
 The spaceship has been designed with comprehensive reference to the Russian spaceship Soyuz. The spaceship is composed of three cylindrical capsules, with the orbiter capsule fitted on the forefront. Its interior is equipped with corresponding facilities for space observation and space drug and microgravity tests. The return capsule, connected to the orbiter capsule, is the cockpit of the astronauts and the only capsule that will reenter the atmosphere for landing. Three reclining seats will be installed in the capsule for astronauts. Instrument panel, control shaft, and optical telescope will be installed below the seats. At the rear of the spaceship is the propulsion capsule to provide thrust to the spaceship in orbital control and return to earth. In accordance with the plan, China's manned spaceship will conduct a series of scientific tests and earth observation after it is launched into space. 
	
	
 Space technology will not only be used for civilian, but also for military purposes, and there is no exception for China. It is speculated that the spaceship will almost certainly be equipped with facilities relating to military observation and attack on enemy satellites. Therefore, the manned spaceflight will enable China to have preliminary space combat capability. 
	
	
 According to the experience of the United States and Russia, one of the greatest problems of manned spaceship is inadequate power supply. The solar energy batteries usually cannot meet the needs of numerous equipment on a spaceship. However, it is understood that China has successfully resolved this problem to provide sufficient power supply for its spaceship. After completing the orbital flight, the spaceship will adjust itself to the return position by following ground command and ignite the engine to change to the orbit for returning to the earth. Before gliding into the atmosphere, the orbiter and propulsion capsules will be discarded. 
	
	
 By referring to the designs of the Russia spaceship Soyuz, it is very possible that China will apply the lift control technology in its manned spaceship. This technology will enable the spaceship to limit its mobility in the atmosphere. In the altitude of about several thousands of meters, the return capsule will eject the parachutes to further reduce the speed. It is reported that in the past China's recovery site for returning satellites was in the mountains of Sichuan Province. 
	
	
 To facilitate recovery and rescue in future manned spaceflight, the recovery site will be located in sparsely populated grassland or the wilderness. Judging from the selection of recovery sites for the two previous flights, the site for recovering the manned spaceship may be situated in the grassland of Inner Mongolia. 
	
	
 The next step after the land recovery, China may change to recovering the manned spaceship on the sea. 
	
	
 An informed source has said that it can be seen that the designs for China's manned spaceflight have taken into consideration future modifications. For the next flight, the top of the spaceship's orbiter capsule may be installed with a docking module for docking tests between two spaceships. The concerned person said that this is a prelude to China's space station development plan.

Finance Minister Pedro Malan insisted yesterday on the need for a ""more profound constructive engagement"" on the part of multilateral institutions and governments in helping Argentina. According to Malan, another approach is necessary in this period of transition of the Argentine crisis. He suggests the definition of a series of priorities. ""The priority now is to unshackle the credit system, for there is no modern economy that can function without credit. Credit needs banks, a functioning payment system. This priority is urgent right now,"" he told participants in the seminar on ""The Euro and Brazil,"" organized by this newspaper. 
	
	
 Malan criticizes the stance taken by multilateral institutions like the IMF, who are asking for reforms in Argentina before the country can receive financial help. 
	
	
 Given the degree of uncertainty that prevails over the inflation, foreign exchange and interest rates and over the economy's real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) this year, the approach should not be the traditional one, the Finance Minister says. 
	
	
 Pedro Malan's attitude in relation to Argentina is very different from that of Jaime Caruana, governor of the Bank of Spain, the Spanish central bank. To Caruana, Argentina has to ""create a broad program that generates internal and external stability and discuss it with the IMF."" 
	
	
 The Bank of Spain Governor did not want to detail what points Argentina should deal with to expand its program. 
	
	
 Spain is one of the leading investors in Argentina, whose instability had a big impact on the results of Spanish banks in 2001. But Caruana said that the banks ""did their homework"" and made provisions for their investments in Argentina. 
	
	
 Malan noted that as part of the constructive engagement in relation to Argentina, a group of experts spent the day with authorities from that country, recounting their experiences in situations like the one the Argentines are facing. In the group were former Bank of Mexico Governor Miguel Mancera, who dealt with the peso crisis in 1995; a former Chilean Central Bank president who faced the 1982 crisis, when the Chilean GDP dropped by 14 percent; former IMF Fiscal Affairs Director Vito Tanzi; an expert in restructuring the Spanish debt; and former Brazilian Central Bank President Gustavo Loyola, who lived through the time of the Collor government's withholdings and of the Proer [Program to Encourage the Reorganization and Strengthening of the National Financial System] - the program to restructure the Brazilian banking system. In Argentina's defense, Malan says that Brazil's Mercosur partner ""has sought to define with clarity the fundamental issues of its basic regimes - foreign exchange (floating exchange rate regime), monetary (they intend, after phase of transition, to define their inflation goal system, which was important to Spain from 1995-1998) and fiscal."" This, the Minister insists, is why ""it makes no sense to demand that everything be done in one or two weeks,"" referring to what the IMF and some governments, like that of the United States, are asking. 
	
	
 Malan defends a single currency for Mercosur. ""We want to keep alight the flame of a single currency in the region in future, even if a distant one,"" but until then, ""there is the job of consolidating the institutions in the political and institutional sphere, of productive restructuring and of modernizing the State"" in six countries - Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile and Bolivia. 
	
	
 The Minister says he is radically opposed to the idea of dollarizing the Brazilian economy. ""We do not want to yield on Brazil's having its own currency, its regional currency. Dollarization is a not very trivial process of negotiation with the country that issues the currency, in this case the dollar, involving complex questions about the role of ultimate lender, the role of the Federal Reserve in the supervision and regulation of the banks in the dollarized country."" According to Malan, the dollarization process is irreversible. 
	
	
 The Minister believes that tension between Brazil and Argentina, resulting from the floating of the real in 1999, will tend to disappear because the neighboring country is opting for a floating exchange rate system. Malan predicts that Argentina will be more competitive when it emerges from the crisis. ""A little calm is needed, the ability to look ahead, not let oneself be carried by the difficulties of the moment,"" he emphasizes. 
	
	
 According to the Minister, Mercosur managed, after an ""enormous technical effort,' something that did not exist in the region two years ago - the harmonization of the statistics of the member countries, Bolivia and Chile, which were not comparable before. 
	
	
 ""Today we have comparable statistics; there is a macroeconomic monitoring group in the Finance Ministry and experts from the six countries' central banks who meet regularly. Based on this effort of statistical harmonization, we announced, in December 2000, an agreement for basic convergence parameters. The presidents of the six countries endorsed certain goals in relation to the debt, GDP, nominal deficits as a proportion of the six countries' GDPs, and maximum inflation. Whoever says that these are small steps is incapable of recognizing the European Union's experience,"" the Minister says. According to Malan, ""long marches start with first steps."" 
	
	
 This was an important step that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso called a little Maastricht, that is, the search for convergence parameters that serve as a reference point for talks between experts from the six countries, the Minister says. 
	
	
 To Malan, however, more important than the harmonization of the parameters and the little Maastricht is the search for convergence of policies in a broader sense - structural, macro and microeconomic ones. The Finance Minister says he hopes, for Mercosur, something similar to what happened in the EU: ""an ability to look decades ahead and not let oneself get beaten down, like in some countries that dedicate themselves to lamenting, that see the difficulties as being insurmountable, and the problems as being unsolvable."" Malan defends a different posture: ""to set aside the notion of cynicism, skepticism, that things will not work out,"" and believe, like the Europeans, that there is a future to be built by the Mercosur countries and Chile and Bolivia, the associate members. 
	
	
 The Minister says that after the October elections in Brazil, it will be necessary to make more progress in the process of making changes to which the country has been committed over the past years.

Mbeki, Obasanjo envoys in fresh bid to save Mugabe 
	
	
 Staff Reporter 3/28/02 1:22:20 AM (GMT +2) 
	
	
 AFRICAN superpowers South Africa and Nigeria this week stepped up efforts to broker a comprise between Zimbabwe's ruling ZANU PF party and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) to ward off the crisis of illegitimacy facing controversially elected President Robert Mugabe's new administration. Presidents Thabo Mbeki and Olusegun Obasanjo, sensing outright isolation of Mugabe and the refusal by many Zimbabweans and the West to recognise his win, have dispatched African National Congress secretary-general Kgalema Motlanthe and prominent West African diplomat Adebayo Adedeji to try to hammer a compromise between ZANU PF and the MDC. 
	
	
 The MDC has also refused to recognise Mugabe's re-election, saying the March 9-11 vote was massively rigged and thousands of its supporters denied the vote. 
	
	
 The two envoys met MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai on Thursday and Saturday last week and outlined their brief and how they intended to proceed in trying to break the impasse. 
	
	
 They also met the top leadership of ZANU PF, which included national chairman John Nkomo and administration secretary Emmerson Mnangagwa, both heavily tipped to become vice presidents and possible successors to Mugabe. 
	
	
 Mbeki and Obasanjo have given the duo three weeks to come up with a solution that will help bridge the rift between the two political parties and arrest the deteriorating political and economic crisis in the country. 
	
	
 According to sources, the two Zimbabwean political parties were asked to draw up agendas for talks as the first step to finding a compromise to the current crisis. 
	
	
 Diplomatic sources say African leaders are frantically making efforts to bring the MDC on board through the formation of a coalition government in order to facilitate recognition of the Zimbabwean government by the international community and unlock much-needed foreign aid that has been suspended. 
	
	
 The MDC has said it wants fresh elections conducted under international supervision by the United Nations within the shortest possible period. 
	
	
 ZANU PF however wants the MDC to accept the result of the presidential election and join it in a coalition government whose composition is not yet clear. 
	
	
 The sources said the formation of a coalition government being pushed by Mbeki and Obasanjo was the most ideal way to stave off international isolation of Zimbabwe but has been received with mixed feelings by the governing party. 
	
	
 Others say ZANU PF only wants the MDC on board to facilitate international recognition and the financing of its economic recovery programme and land reforms. 
	
	
 It is also believed that some hardliners in ZANU PF want the current treason charges against Tsvangirai to be used as a bargaining chip to arm-twist the MDC leader into a compromise with Mugabe. 
	
	
 The 54-nation Commonwealth, the 15-nation European Union and most of the former Eastern Bloc states, the United States, the Scandinavian countries and most Western states and Japan have refused to recognise Mugabe's re-election saying it was a blatant fraud and marred by state-sponsored violence. 
	
	
 Mugabe has received support from regional leaders as well as Nigeria, Russia, Iran and China.

Any hopes that were raised by the Arab peace plan have been dashed to pieces with Israel attacking the offices of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at Ramallah. Tanks were moved into Ramallah early Friday morning and subsequently these and bulldozers were used to smash through the perimeter of the compound around Mr Arafat's headquarters. The Palestinian leader has been confined here for several months and the buildings in this complex house the bulk of the security forces of the Palestinian Authority. Over the last few months, Israeli forces have been targeting the symbols of authority of the Palestinian administration. Friday's attack strikes at the heart of this authority. As usual, Israel is projecting its attack as a defensive action - a response to two suicide attacks over the last two days at Netanya and a Jewish settlement, which left about 24 people dead. There is a possibility that the attack on the PA's headquarters could expand into a larger operation. Describing !
Arafat as ""an enemy"" of Israel, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon announced an extended military operation against ""Palestinian terrorism"" ""everywhere it exists"". 
	
	
 Israel's attack on Arafat's headquarters deals a stinging slap on the face of ongoing Arab efforts to negotiate a political settlement to the ongoing conflict. The just-concluded Arab summit had unanimously adopted a Saudi peace initiative, which called for full Israeli withdrawal from Arab territory occupied in the 1967 war, the creation of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital and a ""fair solution"" to the Palestinian refugee problem based on UN resolutions. In return, the Arabs had agreed to consider that the Arab-Israeli conflict is at an end, enter into peace treaties with Israel and open normal relations in the context of this comprehensive peace. Israel's immediate response to the peace plan was to dismiss it as a non-starter. The attack on the PA headquarters barely a day after the peace initiative was accepted by the Arabs clearly indicates Israel's rejection of any efforts to negotiate peace through compromise. It has been clear for some time that the Sharon government is planning on settling issues with the Palestinians through invasion and re-occupation of Palestinian land and then offering a settlement based on its terms. As events over the past two years indicate, a strategy based on imposing a settlement through military means will only deepen anger and provoke retaliatory violence from the Palestinians. The attack on the PA headquarters is an explosive move and has put West Asia on the brink of another war. The international community must act immediately to pressure the Israeli government to step back from the dangerous course of action it is determined to pursue.

Settlers Have Taken Palestine Hostage 
	
	
 A few days ago the parties in the Palestine conflict found themselves at a crossroads. The escalation of the conflict has now cost over 1,000 people their lives in the space of the past 18 months. 
	
	
 One-third Israelis, two-thirds Palestinians. Circumstances have led to a situation where today the two parties in the conflict find themselves on the road that leads swiftly to the abyss. 
	
	
 On Thursday the Arab Summit in the Lebanese capital of Beirut ended with the adoption of a resolution whose content illustrated how far the Arab world has come since the summit that took place in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum in 1967, shortly after the Israeli victory in the Six Days War. 
	
	
 It was then that the Arab heads of state adopted the three noes: no to negotiations with Israel, no to recognition, no to peace. 
	
	
 On Thursday the summit adopted a resolution that proposed the recognition of the Jewish state, normal relations, and an end to the conflict in return for Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian territories that Israel has occupied for almost 35 years. 
	
	
 Even the mention of one of the cardinal problems between Israel and the Palestinians - the future of the 3 million Arab refugees - was couched in terms softer than at any time in the past. 
	
	
 The summit's declaration was the best piece of news the Middle East has produced since the Oslo Accords between Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat were signed on the lawn in front of the White House in Washington in 1993. 
	
	
 The resolution that was put forward by Saudi Arabia was a plea addressed to the Israeli people over the heads of Ariel Sharon's government. No Arab leader was in any doubt that from Sharon's standpoint the resolution was not welcome. 
	
	
 The resolution forced him into a corner. Sharon neither can nor will give up the occupied territories, and so he would be unmasked in the eyes of the whole world as the man standing in the way of peace in the Middle East. 
	
	
 A few hours after the end of the summit chance came to Sharon's rescue. 
	
	
 On Thursday evening a Palestinian suicide bomber attacked a hotel in Natanya where a couple of hundred people had gathered for the traditional Passover meal. Twenty-two people were killed, in addition to the suicide bomber, and 130 were injured. 
	
	
 The bomber was a member of Hamas, the radical Muslim organization. He was known to the Israeli intelligence service. His name figured on a list that Israel had shortly before handed over to the Palestinian security service. 
	
	
 Despite Arafat's promise to take action to neutralize the people on the list, he did not lift a finger. 
	
	
 That same night the Israeli security cabinet met. They decided to take steps to destroy the ""Palestinian terrorist structure, arrest its leaders, confiscate arms, and so on."" 
	
	
 As a first step Israeli forces were sent into the main Palestinian town, Ramallah, where Arafat has his headquarters and from where the autonomous Palestinian areas are administered. 
	
	
 A few weeks previously Sharon had described Arafat as ""irrelevant."" Now he declared that Arafat was an ""enemy."" 
	
	
 He is now a prisoner in his own headquarters. The Palestinian Authority has effectively ceased to function. 
	
	
 Prior to the Natanya massacre Washington had imposed a number of limitations on Sharon. Israeli's antiterrorist operations must not bring the Palestinian Authority to collapse, Israeli forces must not reconquer the territories under the jurisdiction of the authority, and Arafat the man must not be molested. 
	
	
 This time Washington is largely keeping silent. It has not sent the usual appeals to both sides. Quite the reverse: Anonymous U.S. sources say that Washington holds Arafat responsible for the fact that U.S. mediator Anthony Zinni's endeavors to arrange a cease-fire have now foundered. 
	
	
 According to these sources, Sharon had accepted the cease-fire proposal, while Arafat hesitated. Before he had announced his agreement, the Natanya massacre and the Israeli counteraction occurred. 
	
	
 For the time being at least the United States has thus given Sharon a free hand. His problem is that he does not know what to do with it. The action that is currently taking place can at best only throw the terrorist groups off balance for a time. 
	
	
 It cannot solve the Israeli people's security problems, because the root of the terrorism is the Israeli occupation and the Israeli settlements on occupied territory. 
	
	
 The settlers, who number around 220,000 people, have taken the Israeli Government and consequently both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples hostage. 
	
	
 Sharon is a master of escalation. He demonstrated this he as defense minister during the 1982 invasion of Lebanon, which led to Arafat's being forced into exile in Tunis. It is likely that at present Sharon is entertaining similar thoughts and wants to create step by step a situation that will make it possible for him to rid himself of his enemy. 
	
	
 But this is a conflict without winners. Military superiority cannot solve problems that are fundamentally of a political nature. The day the Israeli tanks again leave Ramallah they will have sown the seed for new terrorist actions. 
	
	
 Terrorism thrives in an atmosphere of hate, and the Israeli occupation and the use of military force are creating the fertile soil from which future terrorists will be recruited.

Beijing, March 31 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan Sunday urged immediate withdrawal of Israeli troops from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's residence and called for Arafat 's personal safety to be ensured. 
	
	
 Meanwhile, China opposes and condemns the recent violent activities in Israeli territory, and China expresses condolence, sympathy and solicitude to the family members of the victims, said Tang. 
	
	
 Tang made the remarks in a phone conversation with Israeli Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. 
	
	
 Tang said that the abrupt escalation of the conflict between Israel and Palestine has caused huge casualties and property losses, and Arafat's personal safety was severely endangered. 
	
	
 The Chinese government is deeply concerned about the sudden deterioration in the Middle East situation, Tang said. 
	
	
 Arafat, as leader of the Palestinian people and one of the initiators of peace talks between Israel and Palestine, has made great efforts to push forward the Middle East peace process, Tang said, stressing that disastrous consequences would happen to the Middle East region if unexpected incidents took place to Arafat's safety. 
	
	
 Tang expressed his hope that Israel will implement Resolution 1402 of the United Nations Security Council unconditionally, withdraw its troops completely from Palestinian areas and solve the problems through peaceful means. 
	
	
 Tang asked Israel to do so in order to serve the overall requirement of security and stability in the Middle East as well as Israel's own long-term interest. 
	
	
 The pressing matter of the moment is that Israel and Palestine should both exercise maximum restraint and adopt concrete measures to stop the conflict immediately and create conditions for resumption of the peace talks, Tang said. 
	
	
 Peres briefed Tang on the latest development of the conflict between the two sides. In response to Tang's enquiry, he expressed that Israel is willing to promise to the international community that Israel will not threaten Arafat's personal safety and will not destroy the Palestine National Authority.

JAMMU, Apr 2 -- Chief Minister Dr. Farooq Abdullah today accused Pakistan army for breeding terrorism in India to remain in power against the wishes of their people who want peace. 
	
	
 'For their sustenance and survival, Pak generals have been throttling the voice of Pakistanis who wish to live in friendship and cordiality with their neighbours', the Chief Minister said while addressing a function organised by United Public High School at Channi Himat here this afternoon. 
	
	
 The Chief Minister described Pakistan as mother of terrorism and said if the world has to rid itself from this menace, the perpetrators across the border had to be dealt with firmly. He said mere positioning of army at borders was not enough as infiltration was still continuing. The ultras were indulging in blood-shed and their lunaticism has touched such heights that they were not even sparing the worship places, he said and referred to the attack in Raghunath bazaar and temple complex. He cautioned the people against the enemy and said that extra vigil will certainly help in nabbing suspects. 
	
	
 Reiterating that Pakistan will not give up terror, the Chief Minister said that ultimately the demon they have reared will eat up their own vitals. 'Those digging graves for others, get engraved themselves', he said while citing the example of Afghanistan. He said Pakistan is attempting hard to put India in communal flames so that forces are withdrawn from the borders to deal with the internal situations, thereby leaving field day for ultras to cross over to this side. 
	
	
 Dr Abdullah also dwelt on the spread of education saying that teaching younger generation means steering the nation to prosperity and progress. 'Concentrate on those today who are the builders of nation tomorrow', he asked the teachers community while appreciating the involvement of parents in career building of their wards. 
	
	
 Responding to the demands put forth in a memorandum by the residents of Chhanni Himmat, Narwal, Malik Marker Bye-Pass, Chhanni Bija, Chhanni Rama, Chhanni Kamala and Ambedkar Nagar, the Chief Minister said that he will get examined the issue regarding addition of 11th and 12th classes in the area. He called for launching a coaching class for various competitive exams, as the area has no such facility. 
	
	
 Dr Abdullah also dwelt on various social services in the area and said that answer to meeting the growing demand of tap water in various localities of Jammu is tapping of Chenab water for the purpose. In this regard, he said, a Rs 400 crore scheme had been prepared a few years back that is currently under process for implementation. 
	
	
 Expressing concern over dwindling moral values in the society, the Chief Minister said that youngsters must get inspiration from their glorious past and respect their parents and teachers. He said due regard to elders and teachers is imperative for harmonious society. 
	
	
 Dr. Abdullah presented best teacher award and appreciated the performance of student artists who presented cultural items. 
	
	
 Minister for Sports and Labour, Mr. Harbans Singh was the chief guest. He also spoke on the occasion. 
	
	
 Among others present were, Mr. Mohammed Syed Akhoon and Mrs Bimla Luthra, MLAs [Ministers of Legislative Assembly] besides students and parents. 
	
	
 Mr Akhoon presented a memento to the Chief Minister on behalf of the management of the school.

BAGHDAD. April 3 (Interfax) - Russian companies sold 70 million barrel of Iraqi crude on international markets in the framework of the 11th phase of the UN Oil for Food program. Russian First Deputy Fuel and Energy Minister Ivan Matlashov made this announcement during a bilateral roundtable discussion coinciding with the 30th anniversary of the USSR-Iraq Friendship and Cooperation Treaty. Russian companies will have exported 118.6 million barrels of oil from Iraq during the six-month phase ending on May 29, Matlashov said. During the 10th phase, lasting between June and November 2001, Russian companies sold 115.3 million barrels. Russian companies will have sold around 1 billion barrels of Iraqi crude for approximately $15 billion during all 11 phases stipulated in the 1996 Iraq-UN memorandum. This accounts for roughly 40% of Iraq's total oil exports, he said. In April, the UN Sanctions Committee will probably lift restrictions from Russia-Iraq contracts in different spheres valued at about $900 million. The United Nations has allowed the implementation of contracts worth some $200 million. Of this, Russia's Zarubezhneft foreign trade organization secured 45 contracts valued at about $140 million. Zarubezhneft has shipped $45 million worth of equipment and materials in keeping with 33 contracts. The Iraqi side has pledged to ""take into consideration the Russian Fuel and Energy Ministry's recommendations"" related to allocation of oil export quotas to its Russian partners.

""Contrary to some media reports, Israeli soldiers are not storming into the church, but they have to respond to continual fire by Palestinian snipers, who have taken positions near the church,"" the press service said.

1 What kind of victory is it that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon thinks he is achieving with his ""total war""? After occupying the autonomous Palestinian city of Ramallah, Israeli tanks are pushing further into the Palestinian autonomous areas, occupying other cities and destroying the established -- EU-supported -- infrastructure. The house arrest, temporarily relaxed only after massive international pressure, imposed by Israel's prime minister on Yasir Arafat follows the siege of the Palestinian president's headquarters by Israeli troops. International journalists are being refused access to the cities occupied by Israel, a group of Arab and Israeli peace activists, who wanted to bring food to Ramallah, is expelled by the Israeli Army. 
	
	
 Unimpressed by UN decisions and EU appeals, Sharon is continuing his policy of provocation, which began with his demonstrative visit to the Temple Mount. The last few months have shown that his strategy of suppression has not prevented further suicide attacks, which [attacks] must be emphatically condemned in the strongest terms. On the contrary, it prepares the ground for further hatred and a further escalation of the violence. With his campaign against Palestine Sharon is jeopardizing relations with the Arab states, whose peace offer (Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah's peace plan) he has just turned down. This policy is supposed to guarantee Israel's security? 
	
	
 A few days ago the Israeli prime minister himself referred to the Lebanon war, and in so doing voiced his regret that Palestinian leader Arafat was not killed by Israel at that time. Sharon, who as defense minister in 1982 headed the Israeli Lebanon invasion, at that time -- as was determined by Israel's Supreme Court -- shared responsibility for the massacres in the Palestinian Sabra and Shatila refugee camps and therefore lost his government post in 1983. Sharon, who back then caused serious damage to Israel's international reputation, is well on his way to doing so again. Militarily Israel can win the war against the Palestinians because of its strength; politically -- in the eyes of the world's public -- it looks different. The question arises for the Israeli Labor Party of how long it can still justify a coalition with Sharon. It must be clear to all who want peace that it is time for a different policy. 
	
	
 Israel must -- as was demanded by the United Nations -- withdraw from the occupied territories; international peacekeeping forces should be deployed. A lasting solution to the conflict can only be achieved with the principle of ""land for peace"" determined at the Madrid Conference in 1991. In return for recognition of an independent, sovereign Palestinian state, Israel's right to security from its neighbors must be guaranteed. In this context everyone must be aware that the core of the problem is still the illegally established Israeli settlements in the Palestinian autonomous regions, which have steadily been expanded in the last few years. 
	
	
 In Israel, 338 who refuse conscription are a sign that increasingly more Israelis feel they are held hostage by 250,000 settlers and are not prepared to go to war for the settlements. All who want peace must be aware that the material basis for a security guarantee for Israel will only be supplied with the withdrawal of all settlers and soldiers from the areas occupied in 1967.

 Bangkok, 09 April Kyodo -- Thailand expects China's official response to its proposal for a free-trade agreement Friday when Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra meets Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji on the sidelines of a regional economic conference, local dailies said Tuesday. 
	
	
 Thaksin will leave Thailand on Thursday to visit Hainan Island in southern China to attend the first meeting of the two-day Boao Forum for Asia, which starts Friday. 
	
	
 Local dailies quoted senior Commerce Ministry official Boontipa Simaskul as saying that if China agrees to form a bilateral free-trade area, the time frame will be set immediately. 
	
	
 Boontipa, head of the ministry's Department of Business Economics, said the time frame of the bilateral free-trade area would be shorter than the 10-year time frame envisaged for a free-trade area between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which Thailand is a member. 
	
	
 Senior officials from the 10-member ASEAN and China are due to meet in Beijing from May 13 through 15 to draw up a blueprint for a regional free-trade area. The meeting is the first since the initiative got the nod from their leaders during the annual ASEAN-China leaders' summit in Brunei last November. 
	
	
 The China-ASEAN free-trade area would be the world's largest with a combined market of nearly 1.8 billion people, a regional gross domestic product of US$2 trillion and international trade worth $1.2 trillion. 
	
	
 ASEAN comprises Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. 
	
	
 Thailand and China had preliminary talks on a bilateral free-trade area last year. 
	
	
 Thaksin will also meet with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and South Korean Prime Minister Lee Han Dong on the sidelines of the conference before leaving for home Friday evening.

France says time is right for joint US-European action on Mideast

 Paris, 10 April: ""The conditions are now in place for the United States and the European Union to combine their efforts to work for peace,"" the French Foreign Affairs Ministry said on Thursday [as received - presumably meant to read Wednesday 10 April] following the Madrid meeting on the Middle East. United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the European high representative for the common foreign and security policy (CFSP), Javier Solana, and the foreign ministers of Spain and Russia, Josep Pique and Igor Ivanov, on Wednesday called on Israel to ""withdraw immediately"" from all Palestinian areas that have recently been occupied and collectively expressed their full support to the Middle East mission US Secretary of State Colin Powell is going to undertake. ""This support will be an asset for Mr Colin Powell, to whom we renew our support in his difficult mission,"" according to the communique of the spokesman of the French Foreign Affairs Ministry, Francois Rivasseau.

The European Parliament, which convened yesterday in Strasbourg, decided to advise the 15 member states of the European Union to impose economic sanctions on Israel and, specifically, to suspend association agreements with Jerusalem. In addition, the Parliament called for imposing a weapons embargo on Israel and the Palestinian Authority. 
	
	
 For some time, European politicians have threatened to suspend economic ties with Israel -- a move, which in light of close and extensive trade relations between EU member states and Israel, could cause serious damage. 
	
	
 Earlier this week, Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel, who does not miss an opportunity to provoke Israel, threatened that the EU would once again reconsider its relations with Jerusalem. European Commission President Romano Prodi expressed similar sentiments: in his opinion, the EU should consider imposing an economic ""punishment"" on Israel in protest against the operations of the Israel Defense Forces in the territories. The same goes for Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Pique, who was offended after Israel refused to allow him and EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana to meet with PA Chairman Yasser Arafat in Ramallah. 
	
	
 Despite the Parliament's recommendation, the chances that the association agreements will be suspended are very slim. It takes more than a recommendation from the European Parliament for this to happen; the decision has to be taken by both the European Commission and the EU's Council of Foreign Ministers, on which all 15 foreign ministers sit, and has to be unanimous. 
	
	
 Countries like France and Belgium are easily capable of voting for sanctions against Israel, but other states -- including Germany and Britain -- have exhibited a more balanced position regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
	
	
 However, the fact that certain countries have a more balanced view of the conflict is not the only reason to doubt that anti-Israeli decisions will, in fact, be adopted. The Europeans know that repeated denunciations of Israel, not to mention its punishment, will not lead to a solution of the conflict. Israel will not change its positions on vital security issues, even if the European states eliminate customs breaks afforded to Israeli exports. If the Europeans wish to influence Israel in the political arena -- in a direction that many in Israel would support wholeheartedly -- they will not be able to promote their positions in such a manner. 
	
	
 A unilateral move is likely to prejudice Europe's status in helping to find a solution to the conflict. EU External Affairs Commissioner Chris Patten expressed this clearly Tuesday when he said that canceling the association agreements between Israel and the EU would do nothing to enhance Jerusalem's readiness to listen to European representatives. 
	
	
 What holds true with regard to threats by EU leaders also holds true for threats expressed by certain European states and the means of punishment they might already be implementing. There have been reports that vital components German factories are supposed to supply to the defense establishment are arriving slowly, as is the case regarding the arrival of vital supplies from other European countries. 
	
	
 One cannot assume that Israel will act under the pressure of deeds and oversights that are often tainted with a significant degree of hypocrisy.

GROZNY/MOSCOW. April 11 (Interfax) - A source in Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) said on Thursday that it could be stated ""with a large degree of confidence"" that Jordanian-born Chechen rebel warlord Khattab was killed in a Russian ""intelligence and combat operation."" 
	
	
 ""One can say this with a large degree of confidence as, in the past two months, Khattab has not made his presence obvious in any way - he hasn't been on air, and actions by militants in the region controlled by Khattab are uncoordinated too. Reports by our informers also confirm the likelihood of his death,"" the source said. 
	
	
 The source, who had taken part in the operation, did not disclose its dates. 
	
	
 ""An agent from among the Arabs who are fighting in Chechnya had earlier been recruited by the special services of one of the states in the CIS [Commonwealth of Independent States] and was involved in the operation to liquidate Khattab,"" he said. 
	
	
 The source, interviewed by Interfax in Grozny, expressed confidence that that the command of the Russian forces in Chechnya would soon ""be able to obtain documentary confirmation"" that Khattab was dead. 
	
	
 Official FSB sources in Moscow, when asked by Interfax, declined to make any comments. 
	
	
 Nor has Interfax been able to obtain confirmation from any other source. 
	
	
 Repeated reports last year and this year said Khattab had been killed, but none of them has been confirmed by documentation.

Caracas (AFP) -- The Venezuelan Military High Command maintains its support for President Hugo Chavez despite calls from the opposition to take part in an indefinite general strike declared Wednesday night [10 April], and despite the individual acts of insubordination of two generals on that same day, one of them in command of no troops. Analyst Luis Vicente Leon, head of the influential polling firm Datanalisis, told AFP on Wednesday that the ""president continues to control power,"" and that ""the military sector, despite the emergence of another dissident general, shows no sign of contravening the president's authority: Chavez still controls the troop posts."" 
	
	
 Army Brigadier General Nestor Gonzalez, who commands no troops, appeared at a press conference on Wednesday and made pronouncements against the chief of state, joining five other dissident officers on active duty who rebelled in February. 
	
	
 He was followed by Division General Rafael Damiani, from the militarized National Guard (GN), who condemned the fact that President Chavez ordered troops to use force in putting down a demonstration in Caracas in support of the striking managers of the state-owned PDVSA [Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc.]. 
	
	
 However, the high military commands supported the government during the emergency caused by the strike staged by the trade union and business association opposition, a strike that was extended indefinitely on Wednesday night, according to Carlos Ortega, president of the Venezuelan Workers Confederation (CTV), the largest labor confederation in the country. 
	
	
 On Tuesday, the inspector general of the Armed Forces, General Lucas Rincon, accompanied Civil Defense Minister Jose Vicente Rangel and Energy Minister Alvaro Silva Calderon in a tour of the strategic oil facilities of the state-owned PDVSA, whose managers are completing their seventh day of the strike that paralyzed refining operations and shipments of fuel. 
	
	
 Following their tour, Rincon supported the official report by stating that ""the supply of oil to the main national and international markets (this country's main source of foreign exchange) is normal and meets existing agreements."" Speaking in his turn, Army Commander Efrain Vasquez and General Francisco Belisario Landis, commanding officer of the GN, affirmed that their forces are participating in the Armed Forces' plans of alert and denied that there is any militarization of the facilities of the state-owned Venezuelan Petroleum (PDVSA). 
	
	
 Luis Alberto Camacho, deputy minister of citizen security, reported that 22,000 members of the National Guard, one of the components of the Armed Forces, have been deployed throughout the country in order to safeguard individuals and property during the general strike. At the same time, security at oil facilities at bases of operations and in administrative areas of Caracas has been stepped up, it was reported. Opponents of the president who assembled this Wednesday in one of the offices of the state-owned Venezuelan Petroleum (PDVSA), joining the strike waged by its executives since Thursday [4 April], are carrying signs appealing for support for the men in uniform. 
	
	
 ""Soldiers, where are you?"""" and ""Soldier, support us,"" read some of the posters carried by the strike sympathizers. 
	
	
 General Gonzalez, who reviewed the Venezuelan-Colombian border conflict, accused Chavez of lying when he stated that the Colombian guerrillas are not entering Venezuelan territory and contradicted him: They are indeed entering and ""have been fought militarily"" by troops from this country. 
	
	
 ""With the guerrillas in particular, we supply the dead, while you enjoy politics,"" Gonzalez said, the first of the military officials to rebel on Wednesday. 
	
	
 The second rebel, GN Div Gen Damiani, accused Chavez of having ""ordered the National Guard to use force for the purpose of removing individuals positioned"" in front of one of the PDVSA buildings in Chuao in this capital. 
	
	
 Damiani, an official on active duty, said he had revealed the information in order to try to impede ""this action resulting from a presidential folly that will sully the name of the Armed Forces and especially the National Guard."" 
	
	
 However, Datanalisis analyst Leon indicated that even though Chavez still controls the military forces at the present time, this fact ""constitutes no permanent life insurance,"" since the current indefinite general strike called by the opposition CTV and the FEDECAMARAS [Venezuelan Federation of Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry] leadership is only one battle in a war that he predicts will be a long one. 
	
	
 ""The conflict will intensify in time. The national strike is an important battle in the long-range war whose final result is not shaping up as a romance,"" he said. The analyst observed that ""Venezuela is now radicalized between an inept, abusive and authoritarian government and a neutralized, heterogeneous, impatient and politically immature opposition."" 
	
	
 He further noted that the ""possibilities of negotiation between these two groups are becoming nonexistent. They have an existential conflict: Chavez wants to take over the institutions, and they want to oust him from power."" 
	
	
 Leon added that the opposition has viewed the PDVSA conflict as ""the perfect lifesaver for reviving civilian social pressure for Chavez' ouster from power, this following a cooling"" of such pressure in recent days. 
	
	
 The analyst noted that although there is growing unrest in the streets, the opposition's hope of the immediate exit of the chief of state ""looks presumptuous."" 
	
	
 Leon visualizes two scenarios: In the first, tension will increase in the days ahead, but not destabilize the government, then dwindle toward the end of the week and generate frustration among the opposition over not achieving its objective, a factor that would in turn strengthen Chavez. 
	
	
 The second, ""not to be dismissed,"" he said, is that Chavez will remain strong in his position vis-a-vis his opponents and declare a state of emergency with the suspension of guarantees, the people would declare themselves in a state of civil disobedience, and uncontrolled violence would be unleashed. 
	
	
 ""At this point, the military would have to intervene, either pressuring both sides into a real agreement or opting for an unconstitutional way out (a coup),"" he predicted. 
	
	
 The alternative of a state of emergency was explicitly ruled out this Wednesday by Interior Minister Ramon Rodriguez Chacin.

Tehran, April 13, IRNA -- Police in Iran have recently seized 824 kilos of illegal drugs, mostly opium, during a series of operations in which three smugglers were killed and 18 others injured, police officials said Saturday. The biggest seizure, amounting to 697 kilos, was made in the city of Iranshahr in the Sistan Baluchestan province, where four fire arms were also confiscated. The rest of the hauls were made in the provinces of southern Fars and southeastern Khorasan. Meanwhile, a police head said Saturday that some 877 kilos of narcotics had been seized in the south of the Tehran province in the last Iranian year which ended on March 20, 2001. The bulk of the seizures was opium, weighing 534 kilos, besides 118 kilos of hashish plus other drug assortments. Police dismantled 72 gangs of drug traffickers in the period and arrested 12,910 people on drug-related offenses. An official in the southeastern city of Kerman said Saturday that police in the Kerman province had seized 100 kilos of morphine from drug traffickers in recent days. Iran accounts for 80 percent of the opium and 90 percent of the morphine intercepted in the world, according to the International Narcotics Control Board. The Islamic Republic has launched a relentless anti-drug campaign since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, in which more than 3,100 policemen have lost their lives. Iran's anti-drug campaign costs the country 800 million dollars per year, according to officials. An official said recently that the Iranian police had seized 112 tons of illegal drugs and arrested 306,000 people on drug-related charges during last Iranian year which ended on March 21, 2001.

 [Unattributed editorial: ""The Hidden Message in the Chavez Downfall""] 
	
	
 Oil prices took a sharp downward trend after the quiet semi-coup d'etat by the American affiliated Venezuelan army generals who deposed the popularly elected president of Venezuela Hugo Chavez on Friday. The price of crude had taken a dramatic upsurge in the aftermath of the ever-deteriorating Middle East crisis, the unilateral cut off of Iraqi oil by Saddam Hussein and similar threats by several other oil producing countries. The dethroning of Chavez by the Americans is a message that disobeying Uncle Sam would have cataclysmic consequences. 
	
	
 The US had repeatedly asked Chavez and the Venezuelan government to increase the level of their oil output as well as exports. However, Chavez who is known for his ala Fidel Castro left-leaning anti-American philosophy had on a number of occasions rebuffed US requests for more oil exports. In direct response, the Americans, who preach democracy to the entire planet, recognizing that they could no longer tolerate someone like Chavez reverted to their old bullying and dictatorial tactics and arranged for an army coup by several avowed pro-American generals, who managed to remove Chavez from power in a few short hours. 
	
	
 Venezuela is the third largest exporter of oil within OPEC and the fourth as far as worldwide production is concerned. Venezuela is an important oil producing nation since its oil directly impacts crude prices in international markets. There is very little doubt that Chavez did not voluntarily resign his office and was in fact removed from power by the army. Evidently, during a phone conversation on Friday Chavez told his daughter that he was forced to resign and accept the army's non-negotiable conditions. 
	
	
 In any event, it is more than apparent that the United States intends to play a conspicuous role and exert increasing pressure as far as the oil issue is concerned. It seems that by wielding its authority and exercising dictatorial powers as the world's only superpower, the United States is determined to play a front and centre role in the intricate international game of oil prices and the free flow of this all-important strategic product otherwise known as the ""Black Gold"". The fall of Hugo Chavez in Caracas is a crystal-clear message and warning by the US to anyone in the world who is contemplating to use oil as a political tool in the future.

The news leaked from the reoccupied Palestinian cities confirms that Israeli troops have committed dozens of premeditated massacres against the civilian Palestinian population. This carnage is planned and implemented in compliance with decisions from Israeli field marshals. Israel's atrocities are masterminded by high level Israeli officials including Shimon Peres. That's why they declared the reoccupied Palestinian cities closed military areas into which media people are not allowed. 
	
	
 What happened in Bosnia Herzegovina is being repeated on a larger scale in various parts of the occupied Palestinian territories. People are being killed in masses and buried in collective graves. It is a crime against humanity. The Israeli government is committing crimes of war against the Palestinians and should be tried by an international tribunal just like the governments of Rwanda and former Yugoslavia. 
	
	
 An international tribunal for war crimes has been established in Rome and started its works officially last Thursday with the approval of more than 60 countries. This tribunal will be responsible for trying war criminals. This means we will not need a Security Council resolution to establish the tribunal. 
	
	
 The Palestinian people and the entire Arab World are waiting for a proof that international law protects human beings in general regardless of their color, ethnicity and religion. The world community should not tolerate crimes of war. We are waiting to see that international laws are not selective and that they are not applied for political, cultural and ideological considerations. The public opinion in the Arab and Islamic world is following closely what is happening in the occupied Palestinian territories. We expect the World Community to take a step toward referring the Israeli criminals of war to the permanent tribunal for war crimes.

SALONICA (A.A) - 15.04.2002 - State Minister Kemal Dervis for Economy arrived in Salonica city of Greece on Sunday to attend a conference to be organized by the Black Sea Commerce and Development Bank, and to hold a series of contacts with Greek officials. 
	
	
 State Minister Dervis held a press conference at the Turkish Consulate General in Salonica after his arrival. 
	
	
 Speaking at the press conference, Dervis said, ``economic cooperation between Turkey and Greece will make an important contribution to the Balkans, Middle East and the Black Sea regions. I call it as formation of good economic neighborhood. Turkey and Greece can cooperate in many fields like they have been doing so within structure of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC). For instance, tourism will become the most rapidly developing field for the next two decades. Turkey and Greece have the opportunity of cooperating in tourism.`` 
	
	
 Recalling that the new tender law had enabled everyone to join public investment tenders, Dervis said that Greek investors could benefit from the law. 
	
	
 Noting that financial crisis came to an end in Turkey, Dervis said, ``financial crisis and panic ended. However, I do not mean that we overcame all problems. We should act carefully. We envisage a 3 percent growth in 2002. We also plan to decrease inflation from 70 percent to 35 percent.`` 
	
	
 State Minister Dervis will deliver a speech at the conference. 
	
	
 He is also scheduled to hold a bilateral meeting with Greek Development Minister Akis Tsokhatzopoulos. 
	
	
 After his meeting with Greek businessmen, Dervis will come together with Greek Minister Yeoryios Paskhalidhis for Macedonia and Thrace on Monday. 
	
	
 Dervis will depart from Greece later in the day after paying a visit to Salonica Mayor Vasilis Papayorgopoulos. 
	
	
 State Minister Kemal Dervis has said that regional cooperation structures like the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) were not the antithesis of globalization. 
	
	
 Dervis who arrived in Salonica on Sunday attended the opening of the conference entitled, ``Black Sea Business Day`` which was organized by Black Sea Commerce and Development Bank. 
	
	
 Speaking at the opening of the conference, Dervis defined the regional cooperation as formation of good neighborly field and said, ``the success of Western Europe after World War II laid in its creation of the good neighborly field. For example, South America is not a good neighborly field, and therefore, all regional countries are suffering from difficulties.`` 
	
	
 Dervis said that regional countries` making investment in any sector was not a loss for the other regional countries, but was a benefit, and stated that the investors who got used to the region would also come to the other countries and this was effective especially in tourism sector. 
	
	
 Dervis said that the power of the globalization were stronger than the effects of regionalization. 
	
	
 Dervis went on saying, ``for example, the European Union (EU) is a story of success. It is impossible not to wonder at the creators of the EU. Europe should not be considered as a block which has the definite borders. There were earlier iron curtain countries and their borders were definite. Now they are not. We do not know how Europe will develop towards southeast and east 15 or 20 years later.`` 
	
	
 Dervis who defined the BSEC bank as an interesting idea, said that he believed that if that bank developed within a few years and entered the international markets, the bank would contribute to the improvement of the region in following years. 
	
	
 Dervis stated that Turkey had shown a great economic performance in last 20-25 years, and added that Turkish economy grew by 7-8 percent. 
	
	
 He said, ``unfortunately, crises followed those rapid growth periods lasting for 3-4 years. But around 4.5 percent growth was caught. However, it could be better. We have made many reforms in last period. A total of 21 laws prepared. We will have low inflation and a stable economy as of 2003-2004.`` 
	
	
 Dervis who touched on the cooperation between Turkey and Greece, said, ``the cooperation between Turkey and Greece also have great importance symbolically. I hoped that Turkish and Greek foreign ministers will visit Middle East jointly. This will show that they can convey the message of peace to the third countries.`` 
	
	
 Dervis came together with Greek Development Minister Akis Tsokhatzopoulos following the opening of the ceremony.

Military threat persists after events in Venezuela, Spanish daily says 
	
	
 Excerpt from unsigned editorial, ""Coup against the coup"", published by the Spanish newspaper El Pais web site on 15|April 
	
	
 It may or may not be to the liking of the Western foreign ministries which shared to some extent Washington's pleasure at the ousting of Hugo Chavez, but the course of events in Venezuela has shown that he has the support of the majority of the population, who want him in the presidency, from which he was deposed and in which he was reinstalled by the military in a confused uprising... Criticisms of Chavez's governance have been widespread in the democratic world, above all in the past year, in which he has taken to visiting dictators like Castro or Saddam Husayn and writing to terrorists like the famous Carlos, instead of meeting his promises of prosperity and fair shares. Debatable decisions of his have caused a deep social polarization and brought him into confrontation with representative sectors of civil society, against which he used more demagogy than arguments. But the latest events reveal that his popularity had not collapsed. The coup misjudged its strength and Carmona remaining in power could have led to a serious division of the armed forces. This possibility and the proliferation of expressions of support for the overthrown leader among the military officers made a change of course advisable, with the forced resignation of Carmona and the even more meteoric period in office of Chavez's vice-president, Diosdado Cabello, who only took up the post in order to give his leader time to reappear. All of this leaves in the air a feeling of military uncertainty, after a two-way trip in 24 hours which will undoubtedly leave deep wounds in armed forces which clearly have not given up their wish to exert a decisive influence in political life. The civilian opposition, which in the absence of political parties was organized around the employers' organization and the trade unions, does not come out of it well either. But President Chavez too is seriously damaged by his links to the groups of armed followers who left a score of dead in Thursday's !
[1!
1 April] crushing of the demonstrations. The today revived president will have to tackle the future with different methods. It is time for the former officer to rethink, to set priorities, to understand that the Cuban model no longer works even for Havana, to give up, as he has promised, revanchism and to understand that Venezuela is a Western country where there is no reason for it to be impossible to improve the fate of the Venezuelans and eradicate the eternal scourge of corruption, within a framework comparable to that of the rest of the world. All of which, incidentally, is something of which Chavez has done very little so far.

The Zionist and US administrations have the illusion that they succeeded in defeating the Palestinian people and their valiant intifadah. Therefore, the two administrations, from the position of a ""victor,"" have called for an international or regional peace conference. They have also announced that President Yasir Arafat is no longer fit for the coming phase. In addition, they seek to convince other parties of these two ideas and are waiting for the concerned parties to agree to them, or, at least, to the first one, after which these two administrations will set their own conditions at the table. 
	
	
 It is true that the Palestinian towns are now under occupation, that the Palestinian Authority's institutions have been destroyed, and that Arafat is still besieged at his office as a hostage. It is also true that thousands of Palestinians and their leaders are held hostage, and that the entire Palestinian people are now experiencing the utmost suffering as part of their daily lives. All this is one thing, but the Palestinian people's will is something different. 
	
	
 The Zionists have succeeded in achieving these things, but a deep-rooted fact is that they have not succeeded, and will never succeed, in breaking the will of this valiant people or in forcing the Palestinians into relinquishing their just, legitimate rights and ending their glorious struggle for these rights. It is thus an illusion for these criminal administrations to imagine that they have triumphed and that they are now in a position to dictate their own conditions on this great people. The real victor in this battle is, in fact, the Palestinian people and not the Zionists. 
	
	
 For many reasons, the occupation of Palestinian towns cannot last, so the Zionist forces will have to withdraw from these towns sooner or later. In addition, it is now more impossible than ever to control the movement of three million Palestinians. This is actually one of the deep-rooted facts. 
	
	
 As for the towns and refugee camps that have been destroyed, they will soon be reconstructed by the Palestinian people who have skillfully adapted themselves to the most difficult circumstances. This reconstruction will take place more quickly than what the criminals in Tel Aviv and Washington think. 
	
	
 Most importantly, however, these criminals will have the largest illusion if they imagine that they have succeeded in liquidating the intifadah and destroying its infrastructure after having succeeded in liquidating or arresting a small or large number of the intifadah's leaders and strugglers. Another deep-rooted fact is that the organizations of the Palestinian resistance still preserve their organizational structure and are also characterized by their superb ability to renew their leaders and replace the ones who fall along the path of martyrdom. These criminals know this fact, as much as we, the Arabs, do, because they are in direct contact with it. 
	
	
 As for the intifadah's infrastructure, it has actually widened and turned into volcanoes that are boiling with rage. As has been acknowledged by Uri Avneri, a veteran Zionist writer, the intifadah's structure ""exists within millions of Palestinians and also within tens of millions of Arabs in whose chests the fire of anger is blazing."" He added: ""If more fighters and martyrdom-seeking ones fall, other fighters and martyrdom-seeking ones will emerge, who are ready to follow in their footsteps."" 
	
	
 The conclusion to which we come is that the Zionist and US administrations have aggravated the Zionist entity's historical impasse through the crime they have committed together when they had the illusion that ""force"" can break the Palestinian people's will and impose on this people what other means failed to impose. 
	
	
 Contrary to the visible scene and to the illusion of Sharon and Bush, this Zionist-US crime has confirmed that the Zionist entity's historical impasse is constantly aggravating and that ""the Arabs' recognition of this entity's right to exist"" is now more distant than before despite some official Arab ""recognitions."" Millions of Arabs, Palestinians and non-Palestinians alike, now have a conviction stronger than before to the effect that it is impossible to achieve ""coexistence"" with this usurping, occupying, aggressive, and racist entity.

The hero of the Gulf War, Colin Powell, did not exactly cover himself in glory in his diplomatic mission to the Middle East as the US president's envoy. His task was to create ""a peaceful environment"" in the region currently affected by an unrecognized and undeclared war between Israel and Palestine. 
	
	
 The man who defeated Iraq in 1991 in only six weeks issued a message, saying that the most he hoped for was something less than a mutual cease-fire agreement. Another round of talks will be held today between Powell and the chief players in the Middle East. But the current development of events, that is, the standstill situation, makes it clear that US foreign policy has been put to a very serious test in which the United States needs to discipline its decades-long ally, Israel, and not ruin its relations with the Arabs. 
	
	
 The impression is that, under US sponsorship, the international community deliberated too long about the violence in the Middle East. The latest round of violence was initiated on the day in September 2000 when Ariel Sharon took it upon himself to provoke his Muslim neighbors by visiting an Islamic religious building. Sharon, who used to be a colonel and who is directly responsible for the massacre in the Beirut camps Sabra and Shatila, used his return to power as an opportunity to settle the accounts with his years-long enemies. 
	
	
 Powell's words, ""we are working on this plan,"" are unclear, because he did not say what the plan is, and Israel's call for a conference on the Middle East is also unclear. In relation to the first ambiguity, Powell's words definitely cannot be taken seriously, considering that precisely Washington is the one that has been practicing a one-sided approach to the events in the Middle East for 18 months now and it was the chief opponent of the positioning of peace troops between the two warring sides. With an average $3 billion military aid for Israel and a strong Jewish lobby at home, the Untied States cannot play any other role in the Middle East conflict but protector of the Israeli state. In its warnings and appeals for peace, the United States openly ""takes a side"" in this conflict, labeling the other side terrorists, similar to those who carried out the attacks on the Twin Towers in New York. 
	
	
 It would be entirely improper if, in its defense of Israel, the United States continues to exert pressure on neighboring Arab countries, such as, Syria and Lebanon, which have been accused of supporting terrorist organizations, such as the Hezbolah. It is worrying that among Powell's priorities in Beirut were the talks on the activities of the Hezbolah, with an announcement that terrorists might open a new front. In some circles, these concerns over an alleged new front are seen as an attempt to resolve the smaller Israel-Palestine problem with a bigger one. For example, a new Israeli-Arab war. 
	
	
 The international community received a lot of negative points for the Middle East. Maybe Joschka Fischer's plan for suspending Germany's military aid for Israel, that is, possible EU economic sanctions against Tel Aviv is honorable, but it is a late and disturbingly long-term plan. Europe does not have a united stance on the violence in Ramallah, Nablus, Bethlehem, and the Palestinian refugee camps, despite the clear situation that Israel is the only country in the world that secures its borders by occupying territories of another state. 
	
	
 The EU's efforts and US President Bush's peace initiative through Secretary of State Powell seem like a late resolution, considering that approximately one month ago the Arab countries participating in the summit in Beirut held out an olive branch to Israel through the plan of Saudi Arabia's heir to the throne, Prince Abdullah, which contained two points: recognition of a Palestinian state [as published] in an Arab neighborhood, in return for recognition of the Palestinians' right to their own country. Israel did not even have the goodness to look at this plan, demonstrating arrogance toward everything Arab. In the same manner Israel asked Arafat to leave Ramallah and Palestine, labeling him a troublemaker and politician incapable of controlling the Palestinian suicide bombers.

San Salvador, 17 April (ACAN-EFE) -- Salvadorian President, Francisco Flores, today defended his declaration of support for the interim Venezuelan Government headed by industrialist Pedro Carmona, indicating that the information that he had at the time was that Hugo Chavez had resigned the Presidency. 
	
	
 Flores said, in a press conference, that ""there is no reason to apologize"" to President Chavez, as demanded by Salvadoran opposition parties. ""Our position is very clear, our position was that the new authorities had to receive a vote of confidence to lead the Venezuelan process back to the democratic path,"" he stated. 
	
	
 He added ""we understood that if there were a civilian who had committed himself to call for elections he should receive a vote of confidence."" Flores maintained that ""this is a position that is not unique to El Salvador; it is the position of all the European countries, it is the position of the United States; this is in our view totally reasonable when so little information is available."" 
	
	
 The Salvadorian president considered that the vote of confidence in the provisional government of Carmona will not have any repercussions in relations between El Salvador and Venezuela, which he described as ""totally normal, we are not worried in that sense"". 
	
	
 He explained that ""El Salvador took a different position"" from that of other Latin American countries because at the present time it presides over the Permanent Council of the OAS. 
	
	
 He added that the Latin American countries decided to invoke the OAS Democratic Charter, which implies the investigation all the steps that brought a country to a particular point, and not just simply to determine ""if there were a coup d'etat or not."" He reminded (the press) that currently there is an OAS mission in Venezuela with those very objectives. The commission is headed by Cesar Gaviria, Secretary General of the OAS. He indicated that the Democratic Charter is a new instrument ""and implies that the OAS countries members convene a tribunal"" to investigate the case of a country and ""decide whether or not to remove it from the international community of which it is part;"" something that ""is a tremendously serious process"". 
	
	
 Asked what repercussions an announced visit to Venezuela-by leaders of the opposition party Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN, left wing)-would have for his government, Flores said that ""my concern is that they may be seeking to cause damage to the country."" The FMLN condemned last Friday the actions against the government of Chavez and celebrated his return to the power on Sunday. They criticized Flores for not condemning the rupture of constitutional order in Venezuela. 
	
	
 ""There is no international problem, but rather a manipulation of the subject domestically; and once again I want to ask the FMLN that it does not cause damage to this country. And that in trying to hurt me, it ends up causing damage to the country. It is necessary to be loyal to El Salvador,"" Flores concluded.

Washington, 17 Apr (Xinhua) -- A farce of coup d'etat was staged in Venezuela recently. The leader of the coup had no sooner warmed the coveted seat than he had to beat a retreat under pressure upon pressure domestically and internationally. According to US news media, that coup in Venezuela had something to do with the United States. This maybe a surprise to many people. 
	
	
 Coup d'etat is an unusual means to seize a country's political power. It is an unpopular means because it goes against the tide of the world today. By the same token, the coup in Venezuela has incurred widespread condemnation and objection from the international community, including the Latin American states, except the United States. The US Government's first reaction gave much food for thought when it said Venezuela's constitutional president Chavez ""had himself to blame"" for the coup. This is far out of tune with the attitude the United States used to take when a coup occurred in other countries. 
	
	
 As the saying goes, when you pull up the turnip, mud comes with it. Just as Venezuela restored its constitutional rule and Chavez was returned to power, the New York Times came up with a shocking story: the US Government and senior military officials were in contact with the Venezuelan coup organizers. In recent months, they met with the coup organizers for several times and gave consent to the overthrow of Chavez. Faced with the media's reports, the White House and the Pentagon have had to make statements publicly. They acknowledged their contacts with leaders of the coalition of opposition factions who took part in the coup, but denied having supported them. The Pentagon spokesperson Clarke went a step further to explain that US Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary [Rogelio Pardo-] Maurer for Western Hemisphere Affairs met with Venezuelan Armed Forces Supreme Commander and Inspector General Lucas Rincon in December of last year and made it clear to the latter that the United !
States ""supports democracy"" and that ""we in no way would support any coups or unconstitutional activity."" 
	
	
 Since the United States ""supports democracy,"" then why did Maurer have that meeting with Rincon? Why didn't the United States inform Venezuela's constitutional government of the coup attempt by Rincon and the others? 
	
	
 For every effect, there is a cause. After taking the Office of Presidency, Chavez has implemented an independent foreign policy and seemed to be not in step with the United States in many respects. Take one example. To the United States, Iraq's Saddam Regime is a thorn in the eye and flesh which must be removed. But Chavez in his 2000 visit to some OPEC member states made a stop at Baghdad where he held talks with Saddam. In addition, while the United States is disgusted with the Cuban Government under Castro, the Chavez Government has kept a close relationship with the Cuban Government. Probably this is the major reason why the United States is happy to see a change of government in Venezuela. 
	
	
 In the past, whenever a coup occurred in some Latin American countries, there was always a backdrop of US involvement. The only guideline determining US rejection or support of the government of a [foreign] country is whether it follows US baton and whether its domestic and foreign policies are in accord with the US ""national interests."" On this matter, ""supporting democracy"" is but a signboard used by the United States. Hence one can see that it is not to be surprised that the United States chimed in with the Venezuela's coup organizers. Only it was a little too early to get excited.

Buenos Aires, 22 April (Telam) -- Justicialist Deputy Jose Manuel Diaz Bancalari said today that the IMF ""is seeking to create an uncontrollable social situation"" with the demands it has made of the government and, on the other hand, he confirmed the PJ [Justicialist Party] bloc's willingness to support approval of the draft law on bonds submitted by the executive branch. 
	
	
 ""It seems as if they are seeking to create an uncontrollable social situation,"" the legislator stated this morning, referring to the demands presented by the IMF to the country for reaching a new agreement that would bring in foreign financing for the government's accounts. Analyzing the IMF's responsibility in the complex crisis the country is experiencing, Diaz Bancalari stated his impression that ""the IMF members want more money for themselves,"" without admitting ""any degree of co-responsibility their managers have had in the things that have happened in Argentina."" He believes that ""in any negotiation there may be someone who tries to impose conditions by cheating"" and said that in the case of Argentina, ""the cheaters were the IMF,"" who ""praised the policies (of the last decade) and held them up as an example"" and now ""they cannot tell us that they did not know what was going on."" 
	
	
 ""I think there must be reasonable things"" in the agreement the country reaches with the IMF, Diaz Bancalari said, and then he asserted that ""Argentina is a country in which one can do good business, but what they must know is that there is no more room for shady deals."" At the same time, he admitted the political leadership's ""own mistakes"" and those of his party in particular, acknowledging the existence of a ""certain political vision that is infiltrating Peronism, which is a liberal vision."" ""All the governments are saying that Argentina has to make arrangements first with the IMF before receiving any kind of aid, and they know perfectly well that they are asking us to put 450,000 fellow citizens out of work, and that is only possible with a military government,"" he asserted. 
	
	
 Regarding the draft law from the executive branch on swapping bonds for fixed-term deposits, he believes that if the Senate ""debates and approves it today"" the deputies can ""debate the issue tomorrow and pass it, so that on Wednesday [24 April] the financial system would be open."" 
	
	
 Although he confirmed the PJ bloc's support for the work of President [Eduardo] Duhalde, Diaz Bancalari expressed his surprise at ""the statements by some government officials in which they want to make it seem that there is no will to discuss it in our circles."" However, he clarified that the willingness to deal quickly with the draft law ""does not mean a desire to approve it, because discussing it in the abstract is not very responsible."" 
	
	
 The deputy stressed the value of the bonds the government will issue for the depositors, asking who would want ""certificates of deposit in bankrupt banks"" and saying that instead, ""however we move forward into the future, there will always be the state's legal continuity backing the obligation.""

NEW DELHI, April 22 -- INTERNATIONAL call charges have finally started tumbling down, with Bharti Telesonic Ltd -- the long-distance arm of the Bharti group offering tariffs that are up to 40 percent lower than the existing rates. 
	
	
 Announcing this at a news conference, Mr Sunil Mittal, Chairman &amp;amp; Managing Director, Bharti Enterprises, noted that the tariffs, which would be made available on its ILD [international long distance] services being launched on May 1, would be revised downwards as and when the market demanded it. 
	
	
 ""The present rate cut of up to 40 percent on peak-time rates is likely to be lowered after Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL) and the other ILD operators, who are yet to begin services, announce their rates. Unlike the STD [subscriber trunk dialing] services where a further rate cut may not be feasible, in the international services there is scope for more improvement,"" he said. As per the tariff plan announced by Bharti, peak-time call charges to the SAARC [South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation] region will be offered at Rs 21.18 per minute as against the present Rs 21.82, while for the rest of the world it will be Rs 24 per minute as against Rs 31.30 to Rs 40 that are applicable now. 
	
	
 For non-peak hours, the call rates for the SAARC regions are being lowered to Rs 18 from Rs 18.95 per minute and for the rest of the world at Rs 21.18 per minute from the current Rs 27.69 to Rs 36. 
	
	
 Mr Mittal noted that although the original plan was to launch the ILD services (IndiaOne) by the middle of this month, the company was still awaiting security clearances and the commissioning certificate from the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). 
	
	
 Interconnect agreements had already been signed with almost all cellular operators. The agreement with Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL) would also be signed in the next couple of days. 
	
	
 He also said that agreements with as many as nine foreign carriers across the globe had already been signed. They include AT&amp;amp;T, Sprint, Teleglobe, Eteselat, Saudi Telecom, British Telecom and SingTel to name a few. These nine carriers account for 90 percent of the traffic coming to India. 
	
	
 ""Bharti, after requisite clearances, will offer its network to all carriers on a non-discriminatory basis. Carriers will now connect to Bharti's network and enjoy rates that will enable them to offer deep discounts to the end-consumer. A total investment of Rs 100 crore is planned for the project, of which Rs 75 crore has already been spent,"" he said. 
	
	
 IndiaOne had laid approximately 14,000 km of optical fibre cable covering 90 cities. The company has contracted submarine cable capacity from network i2i, and backed it up with satellite connectivity to build in redundancy. The ILD network is based on IP [Internet Protocol] centric backbone. The multiservices platform comprises TDM [Time Division Multiplexing] switch layer, an ATM [Asynchronous Transfer Mode] and IP layer and intelligent network to offer value-added services, he said. 
	
	
 The company, he said, also planned to start offering Internet telephony services in the near future and deploy Voice over Internet Protocol to strengthen its ILD presence.

AMMAN -- A three-day workshop on money laundering started on Monday, with the participation of officials from several Arab banks, discussing the impact and size of this problem in the Middle East. 
	
	
 During the workshop, organised by the Union of Arab Banks (UAB), participants will also review legislation Arab countries have introduced to combat this phenomenon as well as the ways and means by which money is laundered. 
	
	
 Participants will also explore the role of banking and financial institutions in combating money laundering and the American and European approaches to fighting this problem. 
	
	
 According to UAB Secretary General Fu'ad Shakir the size of money laundering worldwide ranges from 2 to 5 per cent of the world's gross domestic product, which could run up to $1.5 trillion. 
	
	
 He said that banks, real estate, construction projects, stock markets, investing in losing companies and gambling are among the favourite targets for money launderers. 
	
	
 The source of this money includes drug trafficking, arms deals and prostitution which are the major sources of what has been termed as ""dirty money."" 
	
	
 The process of money laundering starts with what has been termed as Placement, or injecting the dirty money into the market, followed by Layering, or removing all traces of the money laundered and finally Integration, where the money becomes ""clean"". 
	
	
 Although interest in this issue started in the 1980's, world attention on money laundering intensified following the Sept. 11 attacks in New York and Washington, Shakir, who was addressing the participants, said. 
	
	
 He said that Arab banks and financial institutions were targeted by the anti-terrorism campaign that followed the attacks. 
	
	
 ""Our institutions are far away from this money laundering phenomenon and Arab governments have amended banking laws to combat money laundering,"" Shakir said. 
	
	
 Jordan was among the Arab countries which introduced measures to fight this problem including tightening banking rules and imposing strict controls on money transfers. 
	
	
 Punishment for money laundering was also introduced, illegal money is confiscated and tough jail terms are given to violators. 
	
	
 Money launderers target countries with low risk of detection, soft tax systems and lenient banking regulations, Shakir said. 
	
	
 He said, according to international agencies which combat this phenomenon, statistically the United States ranks first in term of destination, origin and flows of laundered money. 
	
	
 In Europe, Italy and Russia top the list while China ranks first among Asian countries. 
	
	
 According to Shakir, money laundering in the Arab world is ""very minimal"" but he said that Lebanon and Egypt are classified by international agencies as among the countries that have not taken necessary measures to combat this problem.

Israeli Arab leaders yesterday pledged to fight a proposed 25%-30% cut in National Insurance Institute child benefits for those who have not served in the army or completed national service. The forum of Arab council heads is to meet tomorrow to draw up an action campaign aimed at thwarting the plan, part of a package of recommendations put forward by the Treasury for a NIS 13 million cut in government spending. 
	
	
 Shawqi Khatib, chairman of the monitoring committee of the Israeli Arab leadership, said Arabs would be hardest hit if the government approves the cutbacks in child benefits. Khatib, who also chairs the forum of Arab council heads, said the leadership is diametrically opposed to any cutbacks, particularly when those affecting the lower socio-economic strata of society. 
	
	
 His words were echoed by Muhammad Zaydan, head of the Kafr Manda Local Council. The town, with a population of 14,000, has been at the top of unemployment lists for the past few months. Zaydan said the proposed cut in child benefits would deal a body blow to all those already classed as being below the poverty line. ""Those out of work now, who rely on benefits to support their families, will find themselves in an even worse situation,"" he said. ""This is likely to have ramifications for the future, with children skipping school, going out onto the streets, and getting mixed up with crime, drugs, and violence. We already see that now because of the unemployment situation."" 
	
	
 Officially, some 23% of the working population are registered as looking for work, but council officials believe the real figures are much higher. They maintain that there are many women and young people who have lost their jobs in the last year who are either no longer registered or did not sign as jobless in the first place. 
	
	
 ""I remember when the late prime minister Yitzhaq Rabin did away with the discrimination that had existed for years and equalized child benefits regardless of whether parents had served in the army or not,"" Zaydan said. ""We applauded this move because it was not only just, but it made us begin to feel that we, as Arabs, were an integral part of Israeli society. If this move goes through, we will once again feel that we are being discriminated against.""

Confounding previous forecasts of an economic recovery, the Central Bureau of Statistics today reported that industrial output remained unchanged in February trend data. 
	
	
 Trend figures for all of 2001 showed a 5.5% decline in industrial output. 
	
	
 The figure show the high-tech crisis is continuing. High-tech output fell by an annualized 8% in January-February, following an 8.5% drop in all of 2001. 
	
	
 Output in the electronics, transportation tools, and pharmaceutical industries has fallen an average of 8% this year. Other industrial sectors posted output increases of 0-7% in annual terms. Output in consumer industries, such as food, beverages, textiles, clothing, footwear, and printing, declined by an average of 2.5% in annual terms, following a 4% drop in 2001. 
	
	
 The slowdown in industry led to an annualized 2.5% fall in the number of industrial wage-earners, similar to January's decline and following a 2.8% drop in 2001. The number of wage-earners has fallen by at least 12,000 since the beginning of 2001, including 10,000 in 2001. 
	
	
 The average number of per employee work hours was unchanged in February, following an annualized 2.5% decline in January and a 4.8% drop in the trend data for all of 2001. 
	
	
 Seasonally adjusted figures indicate industrial activity is still declining. Industrial output has fallen by a cumulative 3% since mid-2001 and 10% since the beginning of the security disturbances in late September 2001. 
	
	
 The seasonally adjusted number per employee work hours has fallen by an overall 8% since October 2000. Israel uses the seasonally adjusted data to calculate the State of the Economy Index and estimate business activity.

With all the horrific news that has been coming out of the occupied territories recently and now the shocking swing to the extreme right in the French presidential elections with its threat to France's ethic and religious minorities, virtually no attention has been paid to the reported discovery that two serving US Army officers were involved in the recent failed coup against Venezuela's president Hugo Chavez. 
	
	
 The White House is said to be embarrassed by the report. That must rank as the understatement of the year. The story could have devastating consequence for the Bush administration. A week ago, after Chavez had been reinstated by his supporters, the White House denied any role in the failed military coup, although it admitted that US officials had met Venezuelan opposition leaders beforehand. But they had been told that Chavez, whose friendship with Libya, Iraq and Cuba has angered Washington, should only be replaced by legitimate, constitutional means; the US would not support a coup. 
	
	
 The question now is: Did the White House lie? If it turns out to be true that the two US colonels were involved in the failed attempt, there can be no other conclusion. The two colonels would not have been acting on their own. They must have been under orders -- orders stretching all the way back to the Oval Office. This spells serious trouble for Bush. The whiff of scandal and conspiracy is in the air -- and the American media, ever addicted to conspiracy theories, is not going to let it go. It -- and the opposition Democrats, still smarting at his election victory -- will dig for dirt as long it takes. Even if it finally turns out that the two colonels were operating without the knowledge and approval of the White House, it will be a disaster for Bush. Americans will want to know who exactly is running their country. 
	
	
 For the rest of the world, however, the story already confirms the suspicions that the Bush administration is hell-bent on eliminating its enemies by whatever means possible, legal or illegal. The involvement of US military personnel in the putsch suggests a return to the old days when the CIA would organize coups and assassinations to further US interests. The record is long and to Washington's eternal discredit: the CIA's attempts to kill Fidel Castro, its involvement in the coups in Guatemala in 1954 and in Chile in 1973. President Clinton had, it was thought, closed the book on such nefarious activities. Apparently not. The Clinton era turns out to have been merely an interlude. 
	
	
 Coup making might have been acceptable during the Cold War. It certainly is not any more. Chavez may be a petty-minded populist who had done great damage to his country's economy; but he is also the legitimately elected president of Venezuela. Any US involvement in the attempt to remove him by force puts Washington firmly on the wrong side of international law. What makes it all the worse at this particular point in time is that it makes a mockery of George Bush's war against international terrorism. The world, he says, has to be involved in the struggle against those who seek to attack and destroy law and order and legitimate government. Yet he throws law, order and legitimacy to the wind when it suits him.

Overshadowed by the midst of the tragic events taking place in the occupied Palestinian areas, Venezuela's strong slap on the face of the United States has gone almost unrecognized. I found the statements made by US officials about the recent developments in Venezuela both ridiculous and odd because they all seemed to be playing games. 
	
	
 National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice stated after Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez triumphantly returned to power at the request of his own people that she hoped Chavez got the message that his people had sent to him, which is that his policies are not useful to the Venezuelan people. Of course, she knew who should learn a lesson from this situation, but she was playing games. The return of Chavez following the failed coup attempts that the United States first blessed and then disavowed represented a tough blow to US policy in Latin America, which is also known as America's backyard. It proved that the will of the people is stronger than any force or arrogance of power. 
	
	
 It is worth mentioning that the United States is currently implementing the principle that President George Bush announced following the 11 September attacks, which is that those who are not with him are against him. That is why the coup was planned to overthrow Chavez, who visited Iraq and considered suspending oil exports for one month in protest against the Israeli holocaust against Palestinian civilians. 
	
	
 Moreover, US officials have developed a habit of speaking for other peoples and their interests. For instance, Mr. Bush announced recently that Palestinian President Yasir Arafat has betrayed the hopes of his people. Oddly enough, the peoples that US officials like to speak for are the same ones that suffer from unfair US policies, not to mention that those peoples never gave US politicians the right to speak for them. 
	
	
 The conspicuous policy of playing games that US officials continue to adopt in their statements proves that the Bush administration is playing the part of a thug who is feared by all and who likes to punish anyone that complains about his behavior. 
	
	
 The United States does not want to learn the lesson. It continues to twist the logic of things by turning a blind eye to Israeli murderers and describing Palestinian victims as terrorists. It is certainly playing games.

From the vantage point of Latin America and the Caribbean, there can be no doubt about the United States' complicity with the military and civilian authors of the abortive coup d'etat against Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. From Mexico to Buenos Aires, television viewers saw, on the Spanish CNN and Telemundo channels, the undisguised pleasure displayed by White House spokesman Ari Fleischer and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice at the announcement of Hugo Chavez's ""resignation,"" which he never in fact signed. Far from condemning that which the United States at no time described as a coup d'etat, President Bush's spokesman explained that Chavez had indeed brought it on himself and that he bore the responsibility for the ""confused events,"" having violated human rights. 
	
	
 Following the sudden turnabout and President Chavez's return to the Miraflores Palace after 48 hours, Washington immediately tried to limit the damage. Of course the American Administration had had contacts with the conspirators for several months, but that was in order to advise them to use constitutional methods against Chavez. Otto Reich, the State Department's Latin American policy chief, had indeed met with the short-lived ""interim president,"" boss of bosses Pedro Carmona, but that was in order to urge him not to dissolve the National Assembly. The same advice was issued by the US Ambassador in Caracas, Charles Shapiro, who rushed to the presidential palace, with his Spanish opposite number, to meet with Pedro Carmona. The Spaniard did not specify whether he had attended that hasty meeting on his country's behalf or on the EU's behalf. 
	
	
 Latin American analysts and commentators read in the New York Times and the Miami Herald that ""subtle and informal messages"" of encouragement had been addressed to the conspirators, as was admitted by an unidentified Pentagon official, and that the CIA was not inactive during the months prior to the coup d'etat, as suggested by Stratfor , a newsletter specializing in intelligence matters and published on the Internet. On top of this, there are the latest press reports of the presence of one or two American officers among the conspirators... 
	
	
 Fear of Grim Years 
	
	
 This apparent change of doctrine on Washington's part, following some 20 years of demands -- sometimes successful -- for observance of democratic and constitutional order in Latin America, is laden with threats, in a subcontinent which, during the second half of the last century, experienced a succession of coups d'etat, from Guatemala to Chile, via the Dominican Republican and Argentina, fomented or backed by the CIA and the Pentagon. The fear of lapsing back into the grim years of military dictatorships and revolutionary guerrilla movements has driven virtually all the Latin American countries, with the notable exception of El Salvador, to condemn the overthrow of the constitutional order in Venezuela. Though some of them did not conceal their criticisms of Hugo Chavez, the member countries of the organization of American States (OAS) condemned the coup d'etat and recognized the legitimacy of the elected president. All except El Salvador and the United States, whose representative to the OAS, Roger Noriega, tried for several hours to persuade his opposite numbers that Chavez's ouster was a good thing for the ""hemisphere."" 
	
	
 By some ironical trick of history, it was on 11 September 2001 that the OAS member countries, with the United States represented by Secretary of State Colin Powell, signed a new ""democratic charter"" envisaging regional defense mechanisms for the constitutional regimes. But the attacks that hit the United States that same day initiated a new era, relegating the defense of democratic principles to a subordinate place behind the priority objective of combating terrorism. In the new Manichean world, divided between friends and enemies of the sole superpower, Hugo Chavez was unwise enough to condemn the American bombing raids in Afghanistan. His visits to Iraq's Saddam Husayn and Libya's Muammar al-Qadhdhafi, his friendship with Cuban leader Fidel Castro, his relations with the Colombian guerrillas, his speeches against ""neo-liberal globalization,"" and his commitment to a multipolar world already placed him in the Evil camp, even though the Bolivarian Venezuela has never ceased to guarantee oil supplies to United States, of which it is one of the three foremost suppliers. 
	
	
 By entrusting the conduct of his Latin American policy to the radical wing of anti-Castro exiles, President George W. Bush satisfied the powerful Cuban-American lobby of Miami, which his brother, Jeb, needs in order to secure his reelection as Governor of Florida. But he also took the risk that an obsession -- Fidel Castro's downfall -- would exert excessive influence on the conduct of relations with his neighbors in the South. Implicated in the Iran-Contra scandal, a secret operation against the Nicaraguan Sandinist regime under the Ronald Reagan presidency, the Cuban-American, Otto Reich, was appointed Undersecretary of State for Latin American Affairs, despite Congress' opposition. A former Ambassador to Venezuela, he has never made a secret of his antipathy for Chavez, who he rightly considers the main supporter of the Castro regime. One of the first decisions by the government that resulted from the coup d'etat was indeed to suspend oil supplies to Cuba. 
	
	
 Beyond Latin America, the establishment of a ""friendly"" government in Caracas, representing industry and the conservative circles influenced by Opus Dei, also had the advantage for Washington of weakening OPEC, which Hugo Chavez had succeeded in bringing back to life less than two years ago. Having taken a downward turn following the announcement of the coup d'etat, oil prices have started to rise again since Hugo Chavez's return to the Miraflores Palace.

Nairobi, April 26 Kyodo -- A Kenyan national working for Japan's leading Asahi Shimbun newspaper was shot dead Thursday night in Nairobi in a botched car robbery, police sources said Friday. 
	
	
 Julius Ndegwa, 43, was confronted by a group of armed gangsters around 10 p.m. as he approached his vehicle, which was parked at a sprawling estate east of Nairobi, the police said. 
	
	
 Eyewitnesses said the robbers shot Ndegwa in the chest after he resisted their attempts to snatch his car keys. He was rushed to hospital by bystanders, but died before arrival. 
	
	
 ""They shot at him as he tried to open the door to the car, and died on arrival to a nearby hospital,"" a senior policewoman, Chief Inspector Nancy Thuku, told Kyodo News in Nairobi. 
	
	
 Ndegwa joined the Asahi Shimbun's Nairobi Bureau in 1989 as a driver assigned to the bureau chief, and also worked as the assistant to the bureau chief. He was the official driver of Nairobi Bureau Chief Shingo Egi at the time of his death. 
	
	
 He leaves behind a wife and four children. 
	
	
 A senior police officer was shot dead two months ago by armed gangsters in the same crime-prone area where Ndegwa was killed.

SHUTTLEWORTH-MBEKI by Mariette le Roux BLOEMFONTEIN April 27 Sapa MBEKI SPEAKS TO `AFRONAUT' IN OUTER SPACE 
	
	
 Contact was made on Saturday between outer space and the Free State city of Bloemfontein when President Thabo Mbeki spoke to Africa's first astronaut Mark Shuttleworth, aboard the International Space Station. 
	
	
 Speaking via a live satellite link from Bloemfontein, the president praised the so-called ""Afronaut"" for his contribution to science and Africa's renaissance. ""Yes ambassador, how are you?"" Mbeki started the 10-minute conversation, broadcast live at the Free State rugby stadium. Shuttleworth described his journey so far as very exciting, saying the flight had been smooth and everything was going according to plan. 
	
	
 ""I have had moments of terror and moments of sheer exhilaration,"" he proclaimed. ""I have never seen anything as beautiful as earth from space. I cannot imagine anything as beautiful as that."" The 28-year-old Internet millionaire said he was sleeping comfortably, and the food was not too bad either. He showed the president an empty tin of what had contained his lunch - pork and potato. 
	
	
 ""So far, we've only come to try the Russian food, which was tasty. I am sure the American food will be just as good,"" Shuttleworth told the president. He also reported that he had started setting up for several scientific experiments he was planning to do on board the ISS. 
	
	
 Mbeki expressed South Africa's pride at Shuttleworth's efforts, saying they would go a long way towards inspiring young people to take up subjects like engineering, mathematics and science. Shuttleworth agreed that this was essential towards Africa's rebirth. He said he had seen the most magnificent sunset and sunrise over Africa, at which Mbeki asked him to bring pictures ""so that we can know what we look like to you from up there"". 
	
	
 South Africans should be looking up smiling when he returns, Shuttleworth replied. Shuttleworth also expressed his condolences to the family and friends of Safety and Security Minister Steve Tshwete, who died on Friday night, a message Mbeki undertook to convey. The president then toasted Shuttleworth with a glass of champagne, saying: ""I am sure this will go down in our history as one of those moments where we made quite a leap forward."" 
	
	
 Shuttleworth, accompanied by Russian flight commander Yury Gidzenko and Italian cosmonaut Roberto Vittori, reached the ISS at 0755 GMT, two days after blasting off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The world's second space tourist, Shuttleworth was paying 20 million dollars for his 10-day journey into space, where he would carry out experiments into the HI virus which causes AIDS. The team is to return to earth on May 5.

On the issue whether the coup farce staged in Venezuela not long ago had an ""American background,"" the world media have made many reports, comments, and conjectures. Although the White House and the Pentagon have denied supporting the oppositions in Venezuela to stage this coup, the world will not be easily fooled as it can judge from the several official statements made by the US Government both before and after the coup. 
	
	
 At the time when the abortive coup had just taken place, the United States ""did not show the slightest sympathy,"" still less ""the least regret,"" for the breaking-off of Venezuela's democratic system. Both the White House and the US State Department expressed ""satisfaction"" over the stepping-down of Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's constitutional president, and no one ""wept over him."" Besides, they also claimed that Chavez ""had only himself to blame"" for the coup. When Chavez resumed power, a senior US official in charge of national security commented that ""Chavez should reflect on himself,"" as ""his ship has been sailing towards a wrong direction for far too long."" 
	
	
 As for the recent event in which Jose Bustani, director-general of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW], was voted out of office at the organization's special plenary session, there clearly existed an ""American background."" This special meeting was initiated by the United States, with only one single goal to fulfill, that is, instigating OPCW member states to vote out Bustani. It has been reported that the United States had earlier held a secret meeting with a number of countries, promising to pay for their long due OPCW membership fees if they could vote according to the wish of the United States. 
	
	
 Why has the United States been picking on Chavez and Bustani all this time? After Chavez took office as Venezuelan president, he has pursued an independent foreign policy, and has been out of step with the United States in many areas. During his visits to some OPEC member states in 2000, he also paid a visit to Baghdad; meanwhile, he has all along maintained a close relationship with Cuba. All these are eyesores to the United States. As for Bustani, he hoped that Baghdad could become a member of the OPCW so that the United Nations could conduct arms inspections in the country. To the United States, what Bustani wanted to do was even more intolerable, as it would disrupt the US plan of launching a military strike against Iraq. 
	
	
 Even some major media in the United States have thoroughly unmasked the attitude taken by the US Government towards the cope farce in Venezuela. They have pointed out: When will a ""coup"" not be called a ""coup""? It will not be a ""coup"" so long as the United States thinks it is not! According to New York Times, the United States is inclined to put friendly faces in the Presidential Palace of Latin American nations, no matter whether or not these faces are wearing army uniforms. This reminds one of a witty remark made by US President Franklin Roosevelt in the old days. When questioned by a reporter ""why the United States has supported a certain cold-blooded dictator in Latin America,"" Roosevelt gave a vivid reply: This dictator ""may be a son of bitch, yet he is our (the United States) son of bitch."" 
	
	
 It turns out that in the dictionary used by the United States, the definition of a ""democratic regime"" is subjected to double standards. In simpler terms, the interests of the United States are always above everything else, not only above the sovereignty of other nations, but also above the so-called values of ""democracy"" and ""human rights"" that the US always likes to dwell on. Other than that, nothing will count.

Italian returns from Russian space mission 
	
	
 Text of report in English by Italian news agency ANSA web site 
	
	
 Moscow, 5 May: Italian astronaut Roberto Vittori, a Russian cosmonaut and a paying space tourist, returned to earth today from their ten-day mission, including eight days aboard the International Space Station (ISS). ""It was a tough but gratifying experience. I'm ready to go back,"" Vittori told Italian general Mario Arpino during a telephone call shortly after the Russian Soyuz space capsule made its touch-down in Kazakhstan. Russian officials said the three men, including the world's second space tourist South African millionaire Mark Shuttleworth, were in fine condition. Shuttleworth, 28, who paid the Russians 20m dollars for his jaunt in space, termed the experience ""extraordinary."" He became the world's second space tourist, after US businessman Denis Tito made a similar voyage a year ago. Vittori, 37, spent eight months at Russia's ""Star City"" in preparation for his 10-day mission, dubbed Marco Polo by the Italian Space Agency. During his 8 days aboard the ISS he carried out a series of experiments for ISA [as received] and the European Space Agency on health in space Vittori, a colonel and test-pilot with a wife and two small boys, already has three years training at NASA centres in Houston. His training in Russia combined with his knowledge of American techniques will put him at an advantage if the role of station commander should open up in the future, he said before his training started. The role is currently reserved for Americans and Russians. Italy's Umberto Guidoni was the first European to set foot on board the ISS in April 2000, while a third Italian astronaut, Paolo Nespoli, is scheduled to make his trip in 2003-2004. The estimated cost of Vittori's flight with the Russians was around 12.5m dollars. This covered his training, that of a Belgian substitute and the cost of carrying two scientific experiments on board the Russian Soyuz rocket.

5:14pm Sat May 4th, 2002 -- Thirty-two non-governmental organisations [NGOs] today said they have suspended all engagements with the Malaysian Human Rights Commission or Suhakam for 100 days since April 24 - when the latest appointments to the commission took effect. Speaking on behalf of the NGOs , human rights organisation, Hakam president Ramdas Tikamdas said the boycott was to protest the government's poor response to Suhakam's numerous recommendations thus far. 
	
	
 ""The NGOs note with deep concern that the government has largely ignored Suhakam's maiden report and its freedom of assembly report. 
	
	
 ""Whereas the Kesas report, submitted after a public inquiry, earned the disdain and wrath of the Prime Minister (Dr Mahathir Mohamad) who summarily dismissed it as a product of `western biased',"" he said during a press conference at the Selangor Chinese Assembly Hall in Kuala Lumpur. 
	
	
 The Kesas report irked Mahathir after it found the police guilty of using excessive force during a mass anti-government gathering along the Kesas highway on Nov 5, 2000. 
	
	
 The NGOs stressed the government has also failed to respect or recognise Suhakam's recommendations and also lamented the decline of human rights in Malaysia. 
	
	
 Ramdas said the government's failure to adhere to the commission's recommendations creates the impression that Suhakam is nothing but ""a mere public relations tool"". 
	
	
 ""Over the last two years, the state of human rights in Malaysia has deteriorated with increasing numbers of people detained without trial under the Internal Security Act, with blanket police ban on assemblies, with restrictions to the right of free speech and expression and with further restrictive amendments to the election laws, all of which have further denied our democratic space,"" he added. 
	
	
 The NGOs also noted that the government has yet to show its commitment and respect for universal human rights principles by ratifying the international instruments of human rights, namely the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Covenant Against Torture. 
	
	
 Controversial appointments 
	
	
 Meanwhile, another concern raised was Suhakam's independence following the appointment of former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman as its new chairperson and the decision not to renew the appointments of three commissioners, Anuar Zainal Abidin, Prof Mehrun Siraj and Dr Salleh Mohd Nor. 
	
	
 Ramdas said it was perceived that Anuar and Mehrun, instrumental behind the scathing Kesas report, were dropped for performing their duties without fear or favour. 
	
	
 ""The fact that three commissioners have now been axed is a clear signal to other commissioners that their tenure is dependent on whether or not they have pleased the executive. 
	
	
 ""This clearly undermines the independence of the Commission and will erode public's confidence on it."" 
	
	
 On the other hand, the NGOs said there is nothing in the public records which shows that Abu Talib was committed to protecting civil liberties and advancing human rights. 
	
	
 Claiming that there was ""nothing personal"", the NGOs said their concern was based on his defense of the 1987 'Ops Lalang' where more than 100 people were detained under the ISA [Internal Security Act]. 
	
	
 They added that Abu Talib, during his tenure as AG [attorney general], was also instrumental for the impeachment of then Lord President Salleh Abas and five Supreme Court judges in 1988. 
	
	
 The NGOs also expressed concern over the appointment of five new commissioners which has led to Suhakam being made up mostly of retired civil servants. 
	
	
 The new commissioners are retired Treasury deputy secretary-general Ramon Navaratnam, permanent representative to the United Nations Hasmy Agam, Institute of Islamic Understanding Malaysia (Ikim) director-general Dr Abdul Monir Yaacob, retired Education director-general Asiah Abu Samah and retired National Population and Family Development Board director-general Dr Raj Abdul Karim. 
	
	
 ""Our concern is whether persons used to the role of policy implementors can objectively assess and critique executive policies which impinge on human rights,"" said Ramdas. 
	
	
 Elaborating further on the boycott, Ramdas said the NGOs will not hold any dialogues, send any memorandums or complaints to Suhakam. 
	
	
 ""In the meantime, we will monitor the commissioners in the discharge of their statutory duties in respect of the pending complaints and inquires,"" he said. 
	
	
 ""We will also note to what extent Suhakam will monitor the government's compliance with previous recommendations on various human rights issues contained in its maiden report to the Parliament as well as its other reports,"" he added. 
	
	
 Ramdas said Suhakam's performance will be judged not on the number of statements issued or reports produced but on the improvement of human rights in Malaysia. 
	
	
 ""When the bill (Suhakam Act ) was tabled in the parliament, our Foreign Affairs Minister (Syed Hamid Albar) promised that this would be a positive development in protecting and promoting human rights in Malaysia. 
	
	
 ""We are now looking at Suhakam as an institution to fulfill this promise,"" he stressed. 
	
	
 According to Ramdas the NGOs will meet again after the 100-day period to review their position. 
	
	
 Apart from Hakam, other notable NGOs involved in the boycott are the Malaysian Trades Union Congress (MTUC), Suaram, Amesty International's Malaysian chapter, Jamaah Islah Malaysia (Jim) and Sisters in Islam (SIS). 
	
	
 Boycott unfair 
	
	
 In a related development, Suhakam commissioner Prof Hamdan Adnan told malaysiakini that he was disappointed with the boycott which he described as ""unfair"". 
	
	
 Instead of resorting to such measures, the commissioner said the NGOs should work with Suhakam for the advancement of human rights in this country. 
	
	
 He added the boycott could create the impression that the NGOs were acting out of self interest and are not honest about championing human rights. 
	
	
 ""This action shows that the NGOs themselves do not acknowledge Suhakam and do not want to work with us,"" said Hamdan.

It was only natural for US National Security Adviser condoleezza Rice to make statements yesterday after what can be described as a oneupmanship of rudeness was inaugurated in Washington last week. The legislative branch took part in this oneupmanship by issuing resolutions showing full allegiance to the radical right wing in Israel. 
	
	
 The US legislative branch even outbade the Israeli right wing. If Rabbi Kahana were alive, he would have been regarded as a moderate person, compared to the US legislative branch. Even the most radical Israeli hardliners expressed the idea of the transfer more politely than the most senior, elected US bodies, which called on the Palestinians to give up the West Bank and look for what they called another homeland. 
	
	
 The Congress' resolutions and the statements made by leaders and members of the Congress revealed the US Administration's harbored intentions. Rice's statements came to dot the i's and cross the t's. They served as a crude example of the arrogance of power and attempts to control nations' resources, dictate policies, and impose leaders through pressure and coercion. 
	
	
 The flagrant attack, which Condoleezza Rice launched on the Palestinian leadership yesterday, demonstrates how international dictatorship is practiced by the most powerful country on earth, which claims to be democratic and an advocate of nations' right to choose their leaders. 
	
	
 Rice attacks the Palestinian leadership, which was democratically elected, as testified by international observers, including former US presidents. 
	
	
 However, she refrains from mentioning the elected Israeli leadership, which moved the Israeli army to occupy Palestinian cities, destroy homes over the heads of their owners, arrest thousands of innocent people, and carry out what many legal and international humanitarian circles described as war crimes or bloody massacres to say the least. A prominent Israeli official, Shim'on Peres, said when his army moved into the Janin refugee camp: ""I am afraid that a massacre may have been committed in the Janin camp."" 
	
	
 The Palestinians did not attack Israeli cities, did not arrest thousands of Israeli citizens, and did not blockade their cities and villages, as was done to the Palestinian people without exception. 
	
	
 Yet, the Palestinian leadership is denounced and attacked while the Israeli prime minister is praised. The US president described him as a man of peace, thereby prompting the world's ridicule sometimes and denunciation at other times. 
	
	
 So, why do Rice and the US Administration launch campaigns against, and interfere in the affairs of, the Palestinian leadership? Rice is aware of the fact that President Yasir Arafat remained under siege in his headquarters in Ramallah for five months, imposed on him by the superior Israeli military in violation of all the accords that were signed by former Israeli governments and guaranteed by the United States. 
	
	
 These accords explicitly stipulated that Israeli forces must not enter the Palestinian-controlled areas, which are called Areas A and cover all the Palestinian cities, naturally including Ramallah. 
	
	
 The US national security adviser should have called for ending the occupation and dismantling the settlements. She knows for certain that this occupation and the settlements, which the Israeli government refuses to remove, represent the only major obstacle to peace. 
	
	
 For its part, the Palestinian leadership has always sought a just peace, not submission to plans aimed at writing off the Palestinian issue and swallowing the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Moreover, the aim of these plans is to make the Palestinians yield to the dictates of the Israeli-US alliance, which seeks a mimic resolution to the Palestinian issue, which will perpetuate the occupation and facilitate the expansion of settlements. 
	
	
 No one, no matter who it is, has the right to meddle in the Palestinian domestic affairs or to impose on the Palestinian people a leadership favored by the US Administration and the Israeli Government and tailored according to their mutual interests. 
	
	
 Both Washington and Israel must realize that the Palestinian people are intelligent enough to read between the lines and understand the long-term aims behind Condoleezza Rice's statements. The calls in Washington for democracy, transparency, and corruption-free system are only made to serve US plans, not out of concern about nations' interests. 
	
	
 However, there are two facts that ought to be highlighted. The first is that the current Palestinian leadership represents the Palestinian people's will, political convictions, and national aspirations. 
	
	
 The second fact is that if Washington is interested in democratic reforms in order to combat terrorism as it says it is, it should pressure the Israeli leadership to end its occupation of the Palestinian territories and stop its repressive practices against the Palestinian people. The United States turns a blind eye to these practices, pretending to forget that they violate human rights and are continuously denounced by the international community.

 HARARE -- Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has accused Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of deliberately withholding food from some areas of the drought-ravaged country as punishment for not voting the correct way in March's election. 
	
	
 Mr. Tsvangirai, the 50-year-old leader of the Movement for Democratic Change, alleged in an interview that a starvation policy is part of a major campaign of retribution the ruling ZANU-PF has waged against him and his supporters. 
	
	
 He also spoke about the support his country's opposition movement has received from abroad, and his pending trial on treason charges, both issues with Canadian connections. But he focused on the violence and hunger that have plagued many Zimbabweans since the controversial presidential election, at least in part a state-orchestrated operation aimed at crushing the opposition, he said. 
	
	
 ""I feel very strongly for these people,"" Mr. Tsvangirai said. ""This is just the pursuance of a vendetta. The situation has escalated wildly since the election. It's part of Mugabe's grand strategy to target the MDC's supporter base."" 
	
	
 He said the situation is worst in southern Zimbabwe, where opposition to ZANU-PF is strongest. 
	
	
 ""The first targets are the farmers and their workers, then rural-area sympathizers,"" he said. 
	
	
 The United Nations World Food Program warned last week that as many as 1.5 million Zimbabweans face starvation from the drought, compounded by government-sponsored invasions of white-owned commercial farms that have crippled production of maize and wheat. Ground corn, known locally as ""mealie meal,"" is the staple diet of millions of Zimbabweans who can afford little else. 
	
	
 Mr. Mugabe acknowledged the country's agricultural problems last week, declaring a ""state of disaster"" brought on by drought and sabotage by white farmers. He made no reference to the economic upheaval caused by the farm invasions, but the government says it is trying to import supplies from South Africa, China, Argentina and Brazil. 
	
	
 Because of restrictions on foreign reporters in Zimbabwe, it was impossible to obtain direct government comment on Mr. Tsvangirai's allegations. But non-governmental organizations operating in the country also said they have been seeing evidence of discriminatory food distribution. 
	
	
 ""Food is now a major issue,"" said Shari Eppel of Amani Trust, a human-rights organization. "". . . We have come across cases of people having to have a ZANU-PF card before they are allowed to buy from the Grain Marketing Board,"" which is the body that controls imports and sales. 
	
	
 In the southwestern region of Matabeleland, for example, cases have been reported where people had to go through a ""cleansing"" routine to purge them of their MDC sympathies before being allowed to buy corn. 
	
	
 ""According to reports we have received, they are taken to the police to denounce the MDC, then to the war veterans, where they go through a public confession,"" Mrs. Eppel said. ""Then they are taken to the local headman to be kept under observation. After a few days, he decides if they can be allowed to buy grain from the GMB."" 
	
	
 Meanwhile, Mr. Tsvangirai alleged, the land-reform plan, nominally launched to resettle one million poor families, is actually putting commercial farms in the hands of presidential cronies and members of the ruling party elite. 
	
	
 He said beneficiaries of the program have included government ministers, MPs, army and police officials -- even Mr. Mugabe's in-laws. 
	
	
 ""The situation we see now is what I call the Last Supper -- it is ZANU-PF's final feast,"" Mr. Tsvangirai said. ""It is a case of take what you can while you can. "" 
	
	
 The opposition leader commended Canada and other countries for invoking sanctions against Mr. Mugabe's regime. But he said Zimbabwe's future rests largely with its own people. 
	
	
 ""The international community can support us so far, but it can never remove the shackles of repression,"" he said. ""The burden really lies with Zimbabweans to fight peacefully for their own freedom."" 
	
	
 He said the violence, hunger and economic turmoil are strengthening his country's appetite for a public campaign for change. 
	
	
 ""There is no struggle without casualties, but we don't want to engineer any reckless action,"" he cautioned. "". . . A systematic, strategic program of mass mobilization is necessary to confront a stolen victory and an illegitimate government."" 
	
	
 Mr. Tsvangirai also touched on his own legal battle with the government: On May 31, he is to stand trial on a charge of treason, accused of plotting to have Mr. Mugabe assassinated. 
	
	
 The opposition leader has denied the charge all along, and although he was reluctant to go into depth about a case still before the courts, he did make brief reference to the prosecution's star witness, Montreal-based consultant and former Israeli intelligence agent Ari Ben-Menashe, who may or may not travel to Zimbabwe for the trial. 
	
	
 ""If the prosecution's key witness is reluctant to testify, how will they proceed?"" Mr. Tsvangirai asked. ""There is no case to answer.""

Moscow, May 8, IRNA -- Deputy head of the Russian Geopolitical Research Institute Lyonid Ivashev said on Wednesday the United States sees part of an axis of evil any country which does not follow the its policies. Talking to IRNA, Ivashev expressed regrets over the fact that the people in some parts of the world are indifferent toward the expansionist policies of the United States and do not proceed to condemn them. He strongly criticized the US war-mongering actions and tactics and said the US war-mongering has posed serious threats to the world. He said the United States has turned into an axis of evil itself and is ignoring even the resolutions issued by the United Nations. Ivashev further said Russia is to develop its relations with the Muslim nations as well as China and India. He said there are deep differences between Russia and the United Stats on a range of strategic, political and economic issues. He said the US officials claim as for the countries described as ""parts of an axis of evil"" are ""unfounded"" and the US claims in this connection are ""sheer lies"". Reacting to the threats launched by the US president George W. Bush against Iran he condemned the United States expansionist policies. US President George W. Bush had in his State of the Union address termed Iran, Iraq and North Korea as ""axis of evil"" and accused them of attempting to develop weapons of mass destruction. Ivashev further said the United States is after gaining superiority over Russia's nuclear capabilities and initiating an anti-missile defense system by the United States shows that country's intentions. He said the United States is after imposing its expansionists policies under the pretext of the fight against terrorism.

Shanghai, May 9 (XINHUA)-- The spreading AIDS epidemic is threatening Asia's economic growth, warned officials from the United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the World Health Organization and bank delegates at ""Investing in Asia's Health"", an Asian Development Bank (ADB) seminar held here Thursday. 
	
	
 Statistics show that about two people in the Asia-Pacific region are infected every minute, and a total of over one million people were infected in 2001. 
	
	
 ""AIDS is casting shadow on Asia's economic miracle, and is turning into a global crisis, as the region accounts for 60 percent of world's population,"" says Michel Sidibe, Director of the Country and Regional Support Department of UNAIDS. 
	
	
 Research newly released by the WHO indicates that societies with a heavy burden of disease tend to experience a multiplicity of severe impediments to economic progress especially to sustainable economic growth. 
	
	
 It suggests that each 10 percent improvement in life expectancy at birth is associated with a rise in economic growth of at least 0.3 to 0.4 percent per year. 
	
	
 ""With an alarming infection growth rate in many Asian Pacific countries, care for AIDS is over-burdening the health care system and is taking away from provision of other health services,"" said Sidibe. 
	
	
 In countries such as China and India where AIDS was still at an early phase of the AIDS pandemic, timely control measures were critical to head off an explosive growth in infection, but these demanded heavy expenditure, he said. 
	
	
 Jeffrey Sachs, director for the Center for International Development at Harvard University and chairman of the WHO Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, believes developing countries should fully recognize the importance of investing in health in their overall development strategy. 
	
	
 In his report, ""Macroeconomics and Health: Investing in Health for Economic Development"", released by the WHO last December, Sachs estimated that total annual health outlays in world's least- developed countries would rise by 17 billion U.S. dollars by 2007 and 29 billion U.S. dollars by 2015 and AIDS prevention and care would account for half the increase. 
	
	
 However, low-income countries would be able to pay 14 billion U. S. dollars and 21 billion U.S. dollars respectively at best, said Sachs. 
	
	
 The WHO's recommendations for each developing country include increasing investment in health and relevant areas like education, water and agricultural development; the establishing of a temporary National Commission on Macroeconomics and Health (NCMH), chaired jointly by the Ministers of Health and Finance to organize and lead the medical as well as economic war against AIDS and other diseases. 
	
	
 Sachs also addressed the exacerbating condition of the AIDS pandemic in China, saying that China had the technical ability to control AIDS infection, but still needed a comprehensive strategy, including local surveillance network, increasing government subsidiary and free medicine for the poor. 
	
	
 The seminar is part of the serial activities of the ongoing 35th Annual Meeting of ADB's Board of Governors.

Geneva, May 10 (XINHUA) -- The insurer Swiss Life has pulled the plug on its planned expansion in China, preferring to concentrate on its core European markets, according to a report by Swiss Radio International (SRI). 
	
	
 The company said on Friday it had already closed its representative office in Guangzhou city, southern China, and was in the process of closing another in Beijing. A spokeswoman said the insurer did not have a license to sell life insurance in China. 
	
	
 SRI reported that Swiss Life decided to pull out of the Chinese market earlier this year. Last month, it announced it was cutting 800 jobs worldwide as part of a recovery plan. 
	
	
 The company ran into trouble after an expansion drive cut into profits. The bottom line was also hit when management failed to rein in costs. 
	
	
 The report said that Chinese mainland was seen as a massive potential market for insurers, who should find it gradually easier to sell their products now that Beijing had joined the World Trade Organization. The Chinese insurance market grew 40 percent in 2001.

Hanoi, May 13 (VNA) -- Vietnam has produced a variety of drugs to control HIV/AIDS in patients suffering with the disease. These include Lamivudin 100mg and Lamizidivir (Lamivudin 150mg and Zidovudin 300mg), according to the Public Health Ministry. 
	
	
 The medicines, jointly produced by the Pharmaceutical Company MST and the Pharmaceutical Plant MST in Ho Chi Minh City, are made of Zidovudine and Lamivudine substances of GMP standards imported from the Republic of Korea and India. 
	
	
 The first Lamizidivir tablets have been sold for VND 19,500 ($1.2) since May of this year, under the permit from the Vietnam Pharmaceutical Control Department. 
	
	
 The department said that it will cost $600 for an HIV/AIDS patient per year at this time, and the following years this cost is expected to stand at just $400/year for one patient as the production of such drugs becomes stable. 
	
	
 Currently, the producer is able to process about 10 million tablets per month to meet the demand for domestic consumption and export as well, according to the Public Health Ministry. In the near future, the ministry added, more kinds of such drugs including Nevirappine, Afaviren and Abavir will be available. 
	
	
 As of March, 2002, 47,514 HIV carriers were discovered across the country, with 6,831 developing full-blown AIDS. As many as 3,780 died of the disease.

MOSCOW. May 15 (Interfax) - As of today, 194,000 HIV cases have been registered in Russia, Federal AIDS Center director Vadim Pokrovsky said at an Interfax press conference on Wednesday. The number of HIV cases totaled around 177,000 in December 2001, Pokrovsky said. Thus, HIV cases are up by 17,000, he said. Furthermore, ""HIV develops over a very long period of time. People become ill in seven or eight years, therefore, doctors cannot monitor all who have contracted the infection,"" he said. The government should take urgent measures to prevent and cure HIV and AIDS, he said. Otherwise, the surging epidemic could turn into ""a national security threat,"" he said.

	 Talks between China and the Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations (ASEAN) about a free trade area went smoothly, senior 
officials said yesterday.  	

  ""We are confident the framework will be ready for Chinese and 
ASEAN leaders to finalize at their November summit,"" said a 
senior official with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Co-operation (MOFTEC).  	

  But the official declined to disclose details about their 
two-day negotiations, saying these are just working level talks 
and more substantial progress will be made at the China and 
ASEAN economic ministers' meeting in September.  	

  The third China-ASEAN Economic Senior Official's meeting, held 
in Beijing on Tuesday, set up a trade negotiation committee to 
hold in-depth discussions on the framework of a free trade area 
in the region.  	

  The trade negotiation committee hosted its first meeting in 
Beijing in the last two days.  	

  The committee said in a joint statement at the end of the 
meeting that it will try to have the framework finalized at the 
China-ASEAN summit in Cambodia at the end of this year.  	

  The framework is expected to cover a wide range of areas of 
co-operation in goods, services and investment.  	

  The framework will contain guidelines, principles, scope and 
modalities for establishing a free trade area, including early 
harvest, special and differential treatment and flexibility. It 
will also take into account different levels of development 
between ASEAN countries and China.  	

  Premier Zhu Rongji and ASEAN leaders agreed at the fifth 
China-ASEAN leaders' summit in November to set up a free trade 
area within 10 years.  	

  Chinese and ASEAN officials said the decision by Chinese and 
ASEAN leaders to establish a free trade area is a ""historic 
milestone in economic co-operation between China and ASEAN"" and 
""demonstrates strong commitments by China-ASEAN leaders to 
regional integration and economic globalization as they pursue 
peace and stability and prosperity in the region.""  	

  A study by Chinese and ASEAN experts shows China's export to 
ASEAN will increase 55.1 per cent to US$10.6 billion and ASEAN's 
export to China will increase 48 per cent to US$13 billion after 
the establishment of the free trade area.

	 MOSCOW. May 23 (Interfax) - The Russian Aerospace Agency is 
continuing its active search for a space tourist candidate who 
would fly to the International Space Station (ISS) in autumn, 
agency director Yuri Koptev told Interfax on Thursday. The 
agency has received three official applications for a commercial 
flight. A source in space circles told Interfax that the 
applications came from one Russian citizen, a woman from 
Australia and one more unnamed person. In line with established 
rules, the agency is processing the applications. In the 
meantime, two Americans, a singer from the boy group NSYNC Lance 
Bass and former NASA Associate Administrator Lori Garver, are 
completing medical examinations at the Institute for Biomedical 
Problems in Moscow to be okayed for a flight. At a joint news 
conference in Moscow this month, Interfax was told that both 
Americans are expected to announce intentions to fly to space. 
The Russian pop group Na-Na has not given up plans for a space 
flight either. The singers passed the necessary medical tests 
last year. However, the Russian Aerospace Agency told Interfax 
that it has not received any official applications from either 
the Americans or the Russian pop group. It added that there is 
growing public interest in space tourism around the world, and 
that it is now seen as a vehicle for increasing personal 
popularity. At the moment, the probability of the third space 
tourist making a space flight this year is 70-80%, informed 
sources told Interfax on Thursday. The set of services related 
to a taxi mission to the ISS on a Russian spaceship ranges 
between $18 and $20 million, agency sources said.
